To mitigate the loss in\nlegibility, we propose a training algorithm inspired by Prover-Verifier Game\nfrom Anil et al. (2021). Our algorithm iteratively trains small verifiers to\npredict solution correctness, \"helpful\" provers to produce correct solutions\nthat the verifier accepts, and \"sneaky\" provers to produce incorrect solutions\nthat fool the verifier. We find that the helpful prover's accuracy and the\nverifier's robustness to adversarial attacks increase over the course of\ntraining. Furthermore, we show that legibility training transfers to\ntime-constrained humans tasked with verifying solution correctness. Over course\nof LLM training human accuracy increases when checking the helpful prover's\nsolutions, and decreases when checking the sneaky prover's solutions. Hence,\ntraining for checkability by small verifiers is a plausible technique for\nincreasing output legibility.

More importantly, it substantially reduces the token cost by 49%-79%\ncompared to the second accurate baselines. Specifically, the open-ended tasks\nhave an average 75% token cost reduction.

Moreover, when transferred to\naugmenting LVLMs, sometimes the hallucination degree of the model is even\nexacerbated.Motivated by the research gap and counter-intuitive phenomenon, we\nintroduce a novel framework, the Active Retrieval-Augmented large\nvision-language model (ARA), specifically designed to address hallucinations by\nincorporating three critical dimensions: (i) dissecting the retrieval targets\nbased on the inherent hierarchical structures of images. (ii) pinpointing the\nmost effective retrieval methods and filtering out the reliable retrieval\nresults. (iii) timing the retrieval process to coincide with episodes of low\ncertainty, while circumventing unnecessary retrieval during periods of high\ncertainty. To assess the capability of our proposed ARA model in reducing\nhallucination, we employ three widely used LVLM models (LLaVA-1.5, Qwen-VL, and\nmPLUG-Owl2) across four benchmarks.

This hallucination phenomenon is even more severe when\nquerying the image in non-English languages, while existing methods for\nmitigating hallucinations in LVLMs only consider the English scenarios. In this\npaper, we make the first attempt to mitigate this important multilingual\nhallucination in LVLMs. With thorough experiment analysis, we found that\nmultilingual hallucination in LVLMs is a systemic problem that could arise from\ndeficiencies in multilingual capabilities or inadequate multimodal abilities.\nTo this end, we propose a two-stage Multilingual Hallucination Removal (MHR)\nframework for LVLMs, aiming to improve resistance to hallucination for both\nhigh-resource and low-resource languages. Instead of relying on the intricate\nmanual annotations of multilingual resources, we fully leverage the inherent\ncapabilities of the LVLM and propose a novel cross-lingual alignment method,\nwhich generates multiple responses for each image-query input and then\nidentifies the hallucination-aware pairs for each language. These data pairs\nare finally used for direct preference optimization to prompt the LVLMs to\nfavor non-hallucinating responses.

Mainstream LLMs\ncan be grouped into two categories based on masking strategy: causal LLM and\nprefix LLM. Several works have demonstrated that prefix LLMs tend to outperform\ncausal ones in scenarios that heavily depend on historical context such as\nmulti-turn dialogues or in-context learning, thanks to their bidirectional\nattention on prefix sequences. However, prefix LLMs have an inherent\ninefficient training problem in multi-turn dialogue datasets. In addition, the\nattention mechanism of prefix LLM makes it unable to reuse Key-Value Cache (KV\nCache) across dialogue rounds to reduce generation latency. In this paper, we\npropose a novel masking scheme called Intermittent Semi-working Mask (ISM) to\naddress these problems. Specifically, we apply alternate bidirectional and\nunidirectional attention on queries and answers in the dialogue history.

These corrosion issues, such as graffiti signs and\nincomplete signatures, bring difficulties in understanding the texts, thereby\nposing significant challenges to downstream applications, e.g., scene text\nrecognition and signature identification. Notably, current inpainting\ntechniques often fail to adequately address this problem and have difficulties\nrestoring accurate text images along with reasonable and consistent styles.\nFormulating this as an open problem of text image inpainting, this paper aims\nto build a benchmark to facilitate its study. In doing so, we establish two\nspecific text inpainting datasets which contain scene text images and\nhandwritten text images, respectively. Each of them includes images revamped by\nreal-life and synthetic datasets, featuring pairs of original images, corrupted\nimages, and other assistant information. On top of the datasets, we further\ndevelop a novel neural framework, Global Structure-guided Diffusion Model\n(GSDM), as a potential solution. Leveraging the global structure of the text as\na prior, the proposed GSDM develops an efficient diffusion model to recover\nclean texts. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated by thorough empirical\nstudy, including a substantial boost in both recognition accuracy and image\nquality.

Typical MIL methods include a feature\nembedding part, which embeds the instances into features via a pre-trained\nfeature extractor, and an MIL aggregator that combines instance embeddings into\npredictions. Most efforts have typically focused on improving these parts. This\ninvolves refining the feature embeddings through self-supervised pre-training\nas well as modeling the correlations between instances separately.\n  In this paper, we proposed a sparsely coding MIL (SC-MIL) method that\naddresses those two aspects at the same time by leveraging sparse dictionary\nlearning. The sparse dictionary learning captures the similarities of instances\nby expressing them as sparse linear combinations of atoms in an over-complete\ndictionary. In addition, imposing sparsity improves instance feature embeddings\nby suppressing irrelevant instances while retaining the most relevant ones. To\nmake the conventional sparse coding algorithm compatible with deep learning, we\nunrolled it into a sparsely coded module leveraging deep unrolling.

However, compound\nemotions often occur in real-world scenarios, and the uncertainty of\nrecognizing such complex emotions over diverse modalities is challenging for\nfeature-based models As an alternative, emerging multimodal large language\nmodels (LLMs) like BERT and LLaMA rely on explicit non-verbal cues that may be\ntranslated from different non-textual modalities (e.g., audio and visual) into\ntext. Textualization of modalities augments data with emotional cues to help\nthe LLM encode the interconnections between all modalities in a shared text\nspace. In such text-based models, prior knowledge of ER tasks is leveraged to\ntextualize relevant nonverbal cues such as audio tone from vocal expressions,\nand action unit intensity from facial expressions.

However,\nthese models struggle with unknown classes common in real-world scenarios. In\nthis paper, we introduce a challenging Open-set Video-based Facial Expression\nRecognition (OV-FER) task, aiming to identify both known and new, unseen facial\nexpressions. While existing approaches use large-scale vision-language models\nlike CLIP to identify unseen classes, we argue that these methods may not\nadequately capture the subtle human expressions needed for OV-FER. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel Human Expression-Sensitive Prompting (HESP)\nmechanism to significantly enhance CLIP's ability to model video-based facial\nexpression details effectively. Our proposed HESP comprises three components:\n1) a textual prompting module with learnable prompts to enhance CLIP's textual\nrepresentation of both known and unknown emotions, 2) a visual prompting module\nthat encodes temporal emotional information from video frames using\nexpression-sensitive attention, equipping CLIP with a new visual modeling\nability to extract emotion-rich information, and 3) an open-set multi-task\nlearning scheme that promotes interaction between the textual and visual\nmodules, improving the understanding of novel human emotions in video\nsequences.

However, the effectiveness of these\nmethods gradually diminishes with the advancement of deep learning techniques\nand the enhancement of initial pose accuracy, primarily due to their lack of\nspecific design for pose refinement. In this paper, we propose Point Cloud\nCompletion and Keypoint Refinement with Fusion Data (PCKRF), a new pose\nrefinement pipeline for 6D pose estimation. The pipeline consists of two steps.\nFirst, it completes the input point clouds via a novel pose-sensitive point\ncompletion network. The network uses both local and global features with pose\ninformation during point completion. Then, it registers the completed object\npoint cloud with the corresponding target point cloud by our proposed Color\nsupported Iterative KeyPoint (CIKP) method. The CIKP method introduces color\ninformation into registration and registers a point cloud around each keypoint\nto increase stability. The PCKRF pipeline can be integrated with existing\npopular 6D pose estimation methods, such as the full flow bidirectional fusion\nnetwork, to further improve their pose estimation accuracy. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our method exhibits superior stability compared to existing\napproaches when optimizing initial poses with relatively high precision.\nNotably, the results indicate that our method effectively complements most\nexisting pose estimation techniques, leading to improved performance in most\ncases.

For human vision the ML task is to\nlink fMRI data with emotional annotations, and the explanations highlight the\nbrain regions strongly correlated with the label. On the other hand, for\ncomputer vision, the input data is movie frames, and the explanations are\npixel-level heatmaps. We cross-analyzed our results, linking human attention\n(obtained through eye-tracking) with XAI saliency on CV models and brain region\nactivations. We show how a parallel analysis of human and computer vision can\nprovide useful information for both the neuroscience community (allocation\ntheory) and the ML community (biological plausibility of convolutional models).\n","authors":["Alessio Borriero","Martina Milazzo","Matteo Diano","Davide Orsenigo","Maria Chiara Villa","Chiara Di Fazio","Marco Tamietto","Alan Perotti"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00493v1.pdf","comment":"This work has been accepted to be presented to The 2nd World\n  Conference on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI 2024), July 17-19,\n  2024 - Malta"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00491v1","updated":"2024-08-01T11:52:56Z","published":"2024-08-01T11:52:56Z","title":"GalleryGPT: Analyzing Paintings with Large Multimodal Models","summary":"  Artwork analysis is important and fundamental skill for art appreciation,\nwhich could enrich personal aesthetic sensibility and facilitate the critical\nthinking ability.

To facilitate the\nresearch progress, in this paper, we step further to compose comprehensive\nanalysis inspired by the remarkable perception and generation ability of large\nmultimodal models. Specifically, we first propose a task of composing paragraph\nanalysis for artworks, i.e., painting in this paper, only focusing on visual\ncharacteristics to formulate more comprehensive understanding of artworks.

While several techniques focus on editing\nappearance, few address motion. Current approaches using text, trajectories, or\nbounding boxes are limited to simple motions, so we specify motions with a\nsingle motion reference video instead. We further propose to use a pre-trained\nimage-to-video model rather than a text-to-video model. This approach allows us\nto preserve the exact appearance and position of a target object or scene and\nhelps disentangle appearance from motion. Our method, called motion-textual\ninversion, leverages our observation that image-to-video models extract\nappearance mainly from the (latent) image input, while the text/image embedding\ninjected via cross-attention predominantly controls motion. We thus represent\nmotion using text/image embedding tokens. By operating on an inflated\nmotion-text embedding containing multiple text/image embedding tokens per\nframe, we achieve a high temporal motion granularity. Once optimized on the\nmotion reference video, this embedding can be applied to various target images\nto generate videos with semantically similar motions. Our approach does not\nrequire spatial alignment between the motion reference video and target image,\ngeneralizes across various domains, and can be applied to various tasks such as\nfull-body and face reenactment, as well as controlling the motion of inanimate\nobjects and the camera.

These methods utilize a\nbipartite graph matching algorithm to perform one-to-one optimal matching\nbetween predicted objects and actual objects. However, the instability of\nbipartite graph matching can lead to inconsistent optimization targets, thereby\naffecting the training performance of the model. Existing literature applies\ndenoising training to solve the problem of bipartite graph matching instability\nin object detection tasks. Unfortunately, this denoising training method cannot\nbe directly applied to text spotting tasks, as these tasks need to perform\nirregular shape detection tasks and more complex text recognition tasks than\nclassification. To address this issue, we propose a novel denoising training\nmethod (DNTextSpotter) for arbitrary-shaped text spotting.

We use the four Bezier control points of the Bezier\ncenter curve to generate the noised positional queries. For the noised content\nqueries, considering that the output of the text in a fixed positional order is\nnot conducive to aligning position with content, we employ a masked character\nsliding method to initialize noised content queries, thereby assisting in the\nalignment of text content and position.

Despite growing interest in T2M, few methods focus on\nsafeguarding these models against adversarial attacks, with existing work on\ntext-to-image models proving insufficient for the unique motion domain. In the\npaper, we propose ALERT-Motion, an autonomous framework leveraging large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to craft targeted adversarial attacks against black-box\nT2M models. Unlike prior methods modifying prompts through predefined rules,\nALERT-Motion uses LLMs' knowledge of human motion to autonomously generate\nsubtle yet powerful adversarial text descriptions. It comprises two key\nmodules: an adaptive dispatching module that constructs an LLM-based agent to\niteratively refine and search for adversarial prompts; and a multimodal\ninformation contrastive module that extracts semantically relevant motion\ninformation to guide the agent's search. Through this LLM-driven approach,\nALERT-Motion crafts adversarial prompts querying victim models to produce\noutputs closely matching targeted motions, while avoiding obvious\nperturbations.

Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning has\ngarnered widespread attention due to its better balance between the number of\nlearnable parameters and performance. However, some current parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning methods only model a single modality and lack the utilization of\nstructural knowledge in downstream tasks. To address this issue, this paper\nproposes a multi-modal parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on graph\nnetworks. Each image is fed into a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to\ngenerate a text description. The image and its corresponding text description\nare then processed by a frozen image encoder and text encoder to generate image\nfeatures and text features, respectively. A graph is constructed based on the\nsimilarity of the multi-modal feature nodes, and knowledge and relationships\nrelevant to these features are extracted from each node. Additionally, Elastic\nWeight Consolidation (EWC) regularization is incorporated into the loss\nfunction to mitigate the problem of forgetting during task learning.

Many current methods focus\non learning feature representations that are both discriminative for\nclassification and invariant across domains by simultaneously optimizing domain\nalignment and classification tasks. However, these methods often overlook a\ncrucial challenge: the inherent conflict between these two tasks during\ngradient-based optimization. In this paper, we delve into this issue and\nintroduce two effective solutions known as Gradient Harmonization, including GH\nand GH++, to mitigate the conflict between domain alignment and classification\ntasks. GH operates by altering the gradient angle between different tasks from\nan obtuse angle to an acute angle, thus resolving the conflict and trade-offing\nthe two tasks in a coordinated manner. Yet, this would cause both tasks to\ndeviate from their original optimization directions. We thus further propose an\nimproved version, GH++, which adjusts the gradient angle between tasks from an\nobtuse angle to a vertical angle. This not only eliminates the conflict but\nalso minimizes deviation from the original gradient directions. Finally, for\noptimization convenience and efficiency, we evolve the gradient harmonization\nstrategies into a dynamically weighted loss function using an integral operator\non the harmonized gradient. Notably, GH/GH++ are orthogonal to UDA and can be\nseamlessly integrated into most existing UDA models.

Our framework, dubbed \\textbf{CoRa} (Optimal\nQuantization Residual \\textbf{Co}nvolutional Operator Low-\\textbf{Ra}nk\nAdaptation), is motivated by two key aspects. Firstly, quantization residual\nknowledge, i.e. the lost information between floating-point weights and\nquantized weights, has long been neglected by the research community.\nReclaiming the critical residual knowledge, with an infinitesimal extra\nparameter cost, can reverse performance degradation without training. Secondly,\nstate-of-the-art quantization frameworks search for optimal quantized weights\nto address the performance degradation. Yet, the vast search spaces in weight\noptimization pose a challenge for the efficient optimization in large models.\nFor example, state-of-the-art BRECQ necessitates $2 \\times 10^4$ iterations to\nquantize models. Fundamentally differing from existing methods, \\textbf{CoRa}\nsearches for the optimal architectures of low-rank adapters, reclaiming\ncritical quantization residual knowledge, within the search spaces smaller\ncompared to the weight spaces, by many orders of magnitude. The low-rank\nadapters approximate the quantization residual weights, discarded in previous\nmethods.

To fill in the missing points, recent studies tend to\nexplore new visual features and design complex networks to reconstruct the\ndepth, however, these approaches tremendously increase computation, and the\ncorrelation of different visual features remains a problem. To this end, we\npropose an efficient depth completion network named DistillGrasp which\ndistillates knowledge from the teacher branch to the student branch.\nSpecifically, in the teacher branch, we design a position correlation block\n(PCB) that leverages RGB images as the query and key to search for the\ncorresponding values, guiding the model to establish correct correspondence\nbetween two features and transfer it to the transparent areas. For the student\nbranch, we propose a consistent feature correlation module (CFCM) that retains\nthe reliable regions of RGB images and depth maps respectively according to the\nconsistency and adopts a CNN to capture the pairwise relationship for depth\ncompletion. To avoid the student branch only learning regional features from\nthe teacher branch, we devise a distillation loss that not only considers the\ndistance loss but also the object structure and edge information.

Typical MIL methods include a feature\nembedding part, which embeds the instances into features via a pre-trained\nfeature extractor, and an MIL aggregator that combines instance embeddings into\npredictions. Most efforts have typically focused on improving these parts. This\ninvolves refining the feature embeddings through self-supervised pre-training\nas well as modeling the correlations between instances separately.\n  In this paper, we proposed a sparsely coding MIL (SC-MIL) method that\naddresses those two aspects at the same time by leveraging sparse dictionary\nlearning. The sparse dictionary learning captures the similarities of instances\nby expressing them as sparse linear combinations of atoms in an over-complete\ndictionary. In addition, imposing sparsity improves instance feature embeddings\nby suppressing irrelevant instances while retaining the most relevant ones. To\nmake the conventional sparse coding algorithm compatible with deep learning, we\nunrolled it into a sparsely coded module leveraging deep unrolling.

To incorporate\nhydraulic constraints and physical relationships into drainage modelling,\nphysics-guided mechanisms are designed on top of the surrogate model to\nrestrict the prediction variables with flow balance and flooding occurrence\nconstraints. According to case results in a stormwater network, the GNN-based\nmodel is more cost-effective with better hydraulic prediction accuracy than the\nNN-based model after equal training epochs, and the designed mechanisms further\nlimit prediction errors with interpretable domain knowledge.

In AlignRec, the\nrecommendation objective is decomposed into three alignments, namely alignment\nwithin contents, alignment between content and categorical ID, and alignment\nbetween users and items. Each alignment is characterized by a specific\nobjective function and is integrated into our multimodal recommendation\nframework. To effectively train AlignRec, we propose starting from pre-training\nthe first alignment to obtain unified multimodal features and subsequently\ntraining the following two alignments together with these features as input. As\nit is essential to analyze whether each multimodal feature helps in training\nand accelerate the iteration cycle of recommendation models, we design three\nnew classes of metrics to evaluate intermediate performance. Our extensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets consistently verify the superiority of\nAlignRec compared to nine baselines. We also find that the multimodal features\ngenerated by AlignRec are better than currently used ones, which are to be\nopen-sourced in our repository https://github.com/sjtulyf123/AlignRec_CIKM24.\n","authors":["Yifan Liu","Kangning Zhang","Xiangyuan Ren","Yanhua Huang","Jiarui Jin","Yingjie Qin","Ruilong Su","Ruiwen Xu","Yong Yu","Weinan Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12384v4.pdf","comment":"9 page paper, 2 page appendix.

These aspects make it very problematic to train a robust model. We\ndemonstrate a workflow for the improvement of semantic segmentation models of\nmicrographs through the generation of synthetic microstructural images in\nconjunction with masks.

Many current methods focus\non learning feature representations that are both discriminative for\nclassification and invariant across domains by simultaneously optimizing domain\nalignment and classification tasks.

In this paper, we delve into this issue and\nintroduce two effective solutions known as Gradient Harmonization, including GH\nand GH++, to mitigate the conflict between domain alignment and classification\ntasks. GH operates by altering the gradient angle between different tasks from\nan obtuse angle to an acute angle, thus resolving the conflict and trade-offing\nthe two tasks in a coordinated manner.

We thus further propose an\nimproved version, GH++, which adjusts the gradient angle between tasks from an\nobtuse angle to a vertical angle. This not only eliminates the conflict but\nalso minimizes deviation from the original gradient directions. Finally, for\noptimization convenience and efficiency, we evolve the gradient harmonization\nstrategies into a dynamically weighted loss function using an integral operator\non the harmonized gradient.

Method: Electronic search was performed using\nMedline, Google Scholar, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane and ProQuest. Studies that\nexamined machine learning or deep learning methods to determine the prognosis\nof COVID-19 using CT or chest X-ray images were included. Polled sensitivity,\nspecificity area under the curve and diagnostic odds ratio were calculated.\nResult: A total of 36 articles were included; various prognosis-related issues,\nincluding disease severity, mechanical ventilation or admission to the\nintensive care unit and mortality, were investigated. Several AI models and\narchitectures were employed, such as the Siamense model, support vector\nmachine, Random Forest , eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and convolutional neural\nnetworks. The models achieved 71%, 88% and 67% sensitivity for mortality,\nseverity assessment and need for ventilation, respectively. The specificity of\n69%, 89% and 89% were reported for the aforementioned variables. Conclusion:\nBased on the included articles, machine learning and deep learning methods used\nfor the prognosis of COVID-19 patients using radiomic features from CT or CXR\nimages can help clinicians manage patients and allocate resources more\neffectively. These studies also demonstrate that combining patient demographic,\nclinical data, laboratory tests and radiomic features improves model\nperformances.\n","authors":["SaeedReza Motamedian","Sadra Mohaghegh","Elham Babadi Oregani","Mahrsa Amjadi","Parnian Shobeiri","Negin Cheraghi","Niusha Solouki","Nikoo Ahmadi","Hossein Mohammad-Rahimi","Yassine Bouchareb","Arman Rahmim"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00208v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00203v1","updated":"2024-08-01T00:00:43Z","published":"2024-08-01T00:00:43Z","title":"OmniParser for Pure Vision Based GUI Agent","summary":"  The recent success of large vision language models shows great potential in\ndriving the agent system operating on user interfaces.

CURL has garnered recent attention for\nits ability to represent instances of many important applications including the\nstandard RL such as imitation learning, pure exploration, constrained MDPs,\noffline RL, human-regularized RL, and others.

We propose an overarching model named the Structurally-Aware Recurrent\nNetwork (SARN), which integrates structurally-aware spatial attention (SASA)\nlayers into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers\ncapture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module\ncaptures the temporal dependencies.

Previous work on\ncross-modal coherence modeling attempted to leverage the order information from\nanother modality to assist the coherence recovering of the target modality.\nDespite of the effectiveness, labeled associated coherency information is not\nalways available and might be costly to acquire, making the cross-modal\nguidance hard to leverage. To tackle this challenge, this paper explores a new\nway to take advantage of cross-modal guidance without gold labels on coherency,\nand proposes the Weak Cross-Modal Guided Ordering (WeGO) model. More\nspecifically, it leverages high-confidence predicted pairwise order in one\nmodality as reference information to guide the coherence modeling in another.\nAn iterative learning paradigm is further designed to jointly optimize the\ncoherence modeling in two modalities with selected guidance from each other.\nThe iterative cross-modal boosting also functions in inference to further\nenhance coherence prediction in each modality. Experimental results on two\npublic datasets have demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms existing\nmethods for cross-modal coherence modeling tasks.

Although Visual Question Answering (VQA) could serve as a developed\ntest field, limitations of VQA evaluation, like the inflexible pattern of Exact\nMatch, have hindered MLLMs from demonstrating their real capability and\ndiscourage rich responses. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of\nsemantics-based evaluators for assessing unconstrained open-ended responses on\nVQA datasets. As characteristics of VQA have made such evaluation significantly\ndifferent than the traditional Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task, to\nsystematically analyze the behaviour and compare the performance of various\nevaluators including LLM-based ones, we proposes three key properties, i.e.,\nAlignment, Consistency and Generalization, and a corresponding dataset\nAssessing VQA Evaluators (AVE) to facilitate analysis. In addition, this paper\nproposes a Semantically Flexible VQA Evaluator (SFVE) with meticulous design\nbased on the unique features of VQA evaluation.

However, these prompts, while beneficial, each possess inherent\nlimitations. The primary prompt design methodologies are twofold: The first,\nexemplified by the Chain of Thought (CoT), involves manually crafting prompts\nspecific to individual datasets, hence termed Expert-Designed Prompts (EDPs).\nOnce these prompts are established, they are unalterable, and their\neffectiveness is capped by the expertise of the human designers. When applied\nto LLMs, the static nature of EDPs results in a uniform approach to both simple\nand complex problems within the same dataset, leading to the inefficient use of\ntokens for straightforward issues. The second method involves prompts\nautonomously generated by the LLM, known as LLM-Derived Prompts (LDPs), which\nprovide tailored solutions to specific problems, mitigating the limitations of\nEDPs. However, LDPs may encounter a decline in performance when tackling\ncomplex problems due to the potential for error accumulation during the\nsolution planning process. To address these challenges, we have conceived a\nnovel Prompt Recursive Search (PRS) framework that leverages the LLM to\ngenerate solutions specific to the problem, thereby conserving tokens. The\nframework incorporates an assessment of problem complexity and an adjustable\nstructure, ensuring a reduction in the likelihood of errors. We have\nsubstantiated the efficacy of PRS framework through extensive experiments using\nLLMs with different numbers of parameters across a spectrum of datasets in\nvarious domains.

Filtering out data\ncan also decrease the carbon footprint and financial costs of training models\nby reducing the amount of training required. Data selection methods aim to\ndetermine which candidate data points to include in the training dataset and\nhow to appropriately sample from the selected data points. The promise of\nimproved data selection methods has caused the volume of research in the area\nto rapidly expand.

As a result, LLMs can exhibit unintended or even\nharmful behaviours, such as leaking information, fake news or hate speech.\nCountermeasures, commonly referred to as preference alignment, include\nfine-tuning the pretrained LLMs with carefully crafted text examples of desired\nbehaviour. Even then, empirical evidence shows preference aligned LLMs can be\nenticed to harmful behaviour. This so called jailbreaking of LLMs is typically\nachieved by adversarially modifying the input prompt to the LLM. Our paper\nprovides theoretical insights into the phenomenon of preference alignment and\njailbreaking from a statistical perspective. Under our framework, we first show\nthat pretrained LLMs will mimic harmful behaviour if present in the training\ncorpus. Under that same framework, we then introduce a statistical notion of\nalignment, and lower-bound the jailbreaking probability, showing that it is\nunpreventable under reasonable assumptions. Based on our insights, we propose\nan alteration to the currently prevalent alignment strategy RLHF. Specifically,\nwe introduce a simple modification to the RLHF objective, we call E-RLHF, that\naims to increase the likelihood of safe responses. E-RLHF brings no additional\ntraining cost, and is compatible with other methods.

In this tutorial, we introduce the\npretrain-finetune paradigm. The pretrain-finetune paradigm represents a\ntransformative approach in text analysis and natural language processing. This\nparadigm distinguishes itself through the use of large pretrained language\nmodels, demonstrating remarkable efficiency in finetuning tasks, even with\nlimited training data. This efficiency is especially beneficial for research in\nsocial sciences, where the number of annotated samples is often quite limited.\nOur tutorial offers a comprehensive introduction to the pretrain-finetune\nparadigm. We first delve into the fundamental concepts of pretraining and\nfinetuning, followed by practical exercises using real-world applications. We\ndemonstrate the application of the paradigm across various tasks, including\nmulti-class classification and regression. Emphasizing its efficacy and\nuser-friendliness, the tutorial aims to encourage broader adoption of this\nparadigm. To this end, we have provided open access to all our code and\ndatasets. The tutorial is highly beneficial across various psychology\ndisciplines, providing a comprehensive guide to employing text analysis in\ndiverse research settings.\n","authors":["Yu Wang","Wen Qu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02504v3.pdf","comment":"29 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01005v1","updated":"2024-08-02T04:40:15Z","published":"2024-08-02T04:40:15Z","title":"Enhancing Financial Market Predictions: Causality-Driven Feature\n  Selection","summary":"  This paper introduces the FinSen dataset that revolutionizes financial market\nanalysis by integrating economic and financial news articles from 197 countries\nwith stock market data.

UHD images inherently possess\nhigh computational complexity, leading existing UHD LLIE methods to employ\nhigh-magnification downsampling to reduce computational costs, which in turn\nresults in information loss. The wavelet transform not only allows downsampling\nwithout loss of information, but also separates the image content from the\nnoise. It enables state space models (SSMs) to avoid being affected by noise\nwhen modeling long sequences, thus making full use of the long-sequence\nmodeling capability of SSMs. On this basis, we propose Wave-Mamba, a novel\napproach based on two pivotal insights derived from the wavelet domain: 1) most\nof the content information of an image exists in the low-frequency component,\nless in the high-frequency component. 2) The high-frequency component exerts a\nminimal influence on the outcomes of low-light enhancement.

In general, GS-based methods\ncomprise two key stages: initialization and rendering optimization. To achieve\ninitialization, existing works directly apply random sphere initialization or\n3D diffusion models, e.g., Point-E, to derive the initial shapes. However, such\nstrategies suffer from two critical yet challenging problems: 1) the final\nshapes are still similar to the initial ones even after training; 2) shapes can\nbe produced only from simple texts, e.g., \"a dog\", not for lexically richer\ntexts, e.g., \"a dog is sitting on the top of the airplane\". To address these\nproblems, this paper proposes a novel general framework to boost the 3D GS\nInitialization for text-to-3D generation upon the lexical richness. Our key\nidea is to aggregate 3D Gaussians into spatially uniform voxels to represent\ncomplex shapes while enabling the spatial interaction among the 3D Gaussians\nand semantic interaction between Gaussians and texts. Specifically, we first\nconstruct a voxelized representation, where each voxel holds a 3D Gaussian with\nits position, scale, and rotation fixed while setting opacity as the sole\nfactor to determine a position's occupancy. We then design an initialization\nnetwork mainly consisting of two novel components: 1) Global Information\nPerception (GIP) block and 2) Gaussians-Text Fusion (GTF) block.

On\nthe other hand, texture plays a vital role in representing facial appearance,\nyet sketches lack this information, necessitating additional texture control in\nthe reconstruction process. This paper proposes a novel method for\nreconstructing controllable textured and detailed 3D faces from sketches, named\nS2TD-Face. S2TD-Face introduces a two-stage geometry reconstruction framework\nthat directly reconstructs detailed geometry from the input sketch.

Consequently, ViT lacks inductive bias during image or video\ndataset training. In contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with their\nreliance on local filters, possess an inherent inductive bias, making them more\nefficient and quicker to converge than ViT with less data. In this paper, we\npresent a lightweight Depth-Wise Convolution module as a shortcut in ViT\nmodels, bypassing entire Transformer blocks to ensure the models capture both\nlocal and global information with minimal overhead.

In this paper, we propose a VLM guidance-based\nsemi-supervised CD method, namely SemiCD-VL. The insight of SemiCD-VL is to\nsynthesize free change labels using VLMs to provide additional supervision\nsignals for unlabeled data. However, almost all current VLMs are designed for\nsingle-temporal images and cannot be directly applied to bi- or multi-temporal\nimages. Motivated by this, we first propose a VLM-based mixed change event\ngeneration (CEG) strategy to yield pseudo labels for unlabeled CD data. Since\nthe additional supervised signals provided by these VLM-driven pseudo labels\nmay conflict with the pseudo labels from the consistency regularization\nparadigm (e.g. FixMatch), we propose the dual projection head for de-entangling\ndifferent signal sources. Further, we explicitly decouple the bi-temporal\nimages semantic representation through two auxiliary segmentation decoders,\nwhich are also guided by VLM. Finally, to make the model more adequately\ncapture change representations, we introduce metric-aware supervision by\nfeature-level contrastive loss in auxiliary branches. Extensive experiments\nshow the advantage of SemiCD-VL. For instance, SemiCD-VL improves the FixMatch\nbaseline by +5.3 IoU on WHU-CD and by +2.4 IoU on LEVIR-CD with 5% labels. In\naddition, our CEG strategy, in an un-supervised manner, can achieve performance\nfar superior to state-of-the-art un-supervised CD methods.\n","authors":["Kaiyu Li","Xiangyong Cao","Yupeng Deng","Junmin Liu","Deyu Meng","Zhi Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04788v3.pdf","comment":"13 pages, 5 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01089v1","updated":"2024-08-02T08:08:56Z","published":"2024-08-02T08:08:56Z","title":"Prototypical Partial Optimal Transport for Universal Domain Adaptation","summary":"  Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled\nsource domain to an unlabeled target domain without requiring the same label\nsets of both domains.

However,\nnaively training a model on all available data may not be optimal (or\nfeasible), as the quality of available text data can vary. Filtering out data\ncan also decrease the carbon footprint and financial costs of training models\nby reducing the amount of training required. Data selection methods aim to\ndetermine which candidate data points to include in the training dataset and\nhow to appropriately sample from the selected data points. The promise of\nimproved data selection methods has caused the volume of research in the area\nto rapidly expand. However, because deep learning is mostly driven by empirical\nevidence and experimentation on large-scale data is expensive, few\norganizations have the resources for extensive data selection research.\nConsequently, knowledge of effective data selection practices has become\nconcentrated within a few organizations, many of which do not openly share\ntheir findings and methodologies.

Even then, empirical evidence shows preference aligned LLMs can be\nenticed to harmful behaviour. This so called jailbreaking of LLMs is typically\nachieved by adversarially modifying the input prompt to the LLM. Our paper\nprovides theoretical insights into the phenomenon of preference alignment and\njailbreaking from a statistical perspective.

In FaMSeC, self confidence\nindicators are derived from hierarchical `problem-solving statistics' embedded\nwithin broad classes of probabilistic decision-making algorithms such as Markov\ndecision processes. The problem-solving statistics are obtained by evaluating\nand grading probabilistic exceedance margins with respect to given competency\nstandards, which are specified for each of the various decision-making\ncompetency factors by the informee (e.g. a non-expert user or an expert system\ndesigner).

The key components of our approach include a\nbipartite graph representation for TPPs to capture the market-product\nrelations, and a policy network that extracts information from the bipartite\ngraph and uses it to sequentially construct the route. One significant benefit\nof our framework is that we can efficiently construct the route using the\npolicy network, and once the route is determined, the associated purchasing\nplan can be easily derived through linear programming, while, leveraging DRL,\nwe can train the policy network to optimize the global solution objective.\nFurthermore, by introducing a meta-learning strategy, the policy network can be\ntrained stably on large-sized TPP instances, and generalize well across\ninstances of varying sizes and distributions, even to much larger instances\nthat are never seen during training.

One\nis based on the Count-Min sketch (CMS) and the other is based on Gaussian\nprocess priors with a random bias. These methods are intended for the most\ngeneral predictive problems where no true model can be usefully formulated for\nthe data stream. In statistical contexts, this is often called the\n$\\mathcal{M}$-open problem class. Under the assumption that the data consists\nof i.i.d samples from a fixed distribution function $F$, we show that the\nCMS-based estimates of the distribution function are consistent.\n  We compare our new methods with two established predictors in terms of\ncumulative $L^1$ error. One is based on the Shtarkov solution (often called the\nnormalized maximum likelihood) in the normal experts setting and the other is\nbased on Dirichlet process priors. These comparisons are for two cases. The\nfirst is one-pass meaning that the updating of the predictors is done using the\nfact that the CMS is a sketch. For predictors that are not one-pass, we use\nstreaming $K$-means to give a representative subset of fixed size that can be\nupdated as data accumulate.\n  Preliminary computational work suggests that the one-pass median version of\nthe CMS method is rarely outperformed by the other methods for sufficiently\ncomplex data. We also find that predictors based on Gaussian process priors\nwith random biases perform well. The Shtarkov predictors we use here did not\nperform as well probably because we were only using the simplest example. The\nother predictors seemed to perform well mainly when the data did not look like\nthey came from an M-open data generator.\n","authors":["Aleena Chanda","N. V.

Physics and geometry-based regularizers are not aware of the global\ncontext and semantics of the object, and the more recent deep learning priors\nare limited to a specific class of 3D object deformations. Our main\ncontribution is a vertex-based mesh editing method called DragD3D based on (1)\na novel optimization formulation that decouples the rotation and stretch\ncomponents of the deformation and combines a 3D geometric regularizer with (2)\nthe recently introduced DDS loss which scores the faithfulness of the rendered\n2D image to one from a diffusion model.

In particular,\ntime-dependent tabular data, where rows are chronologically related, is\ntypically used for recording historical events, e.g., financial transactions,\nhealthcare records, or stock history. Recently, hierarchical variants of the\nattention mechanism of transformer architectures have been used to model\ntabular time-series data. At first, rows (or columns) are encoded separately by\ncomputing attention between their fields. Subsequently, encoded rows (or\ncolumns) are attended to one another to model the entire tabular time-series.\nWhile efficient, this approach constrains the attention granularity and limits\nits ability to learn patterns at the field-level across separate rows, or\ncolumns. We take a first step to address this gap by proposing Fieldy, a\nfine-grained hierarchical model that contextualizes fields at both the row and\ncolumn levels.

As major tech\nenterprises deploy massive infrastructures with thousands of GPUs, existing\ncloud platforms still struggle with low resource utilization due to key\nchallenges: capturing hierarchical indicator structures, modeling non-Gaussian\ndistributions, and decision-making under uncertainty. To address these\nchallenges, we propose HRAMONY, an adaptive Hierarchical Attention-based\nResource Modeling and Decision-Making System. HARMONY combines hierarchical\nmulti-indicator distribution forecasting and uncertainty-aware Bayesian\ndecision-making. It introduces a novel hierarchical attention mechanism that\ncomprehensively models complex inter-indicator dependencies, enabling accurate\npredictions that can adapt to evolving environment states. By transforming\nGaussian projections into adaptive non-Gaussian distributions via Normalizing\nFlows. Crucially, HARMONY leverages the full predictive distributions in an\nadaptive Bayesian process, proactively incorporating uncertainties to optimize\nresource allocation while robustly meeting SLA constraints under varying\nconditions. Extensive evaluations across four large-scale cloud datasets\ndemonstrate HARMONY's state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming\nnine established methods.

Secondly, unlike prevailing margin-based techniques,\ncapitalizing on PC$^2$'s pseudo-classification capability, we generate\npseudo-captions to provide more informative and tangible supervision for each\nmismatched pair.

The Structured Task Hypothesis","summary":"  Large language models (LLMs) exhibit an intriguing ability to learn a novel\ntask from in-context examples presented in a demonstration, termed in-context\nlearning (ICL). Understandably, a swath of research has been dedicated to\nuncovering the theories underpinning ICL. One popular hypothesis explains ICL\nby task selection. LLMs identify the task based on the demonstration and\ngeneralize it to the prompt. Another popular hypothesis is that ICL is a form\nof meta-learning, i.e., the models learn a learning algorithm at pre-training\ntime and apply it to the demonstration. Finally, a third hypothesis argues that\nLLMs use the demonstration to select a composition of tasks learned during\npre-training to perform ICL. In this paper, we empirically explore these three\nhypotheses that explain LLMs' ability to learn in context with a suite of\nexperiments derived from common text classification tasks.

In this paper, we propose UnifiedMLLM, a\ncomprehensive model designed to represent various tasks using a unified\nrepresentation. Our model exhibits strong capabilities in comprehending the\nimplicit intent of user instructions and preforming reasoning. In addition to\ngenerating textual responses, our model also outputs task tokens and grounding\ntokens, serving as indicators of task types and task granularity.

Psycholinguistic,\nmorphological and lexical proxies are often used. Human ratings are also used.\nThe problem here is that these proxies do not measure complexity directly, and\nhuman ratings are susceptible to subjective bias. In this study we contend that\nsome form of 'latent complexity' can be approximated by using samples of simple\nand complex words. We use a sample of 'simple' words from primary school\npicture books and a sample of 'complex' words from high school and academic\nsettings. In order to analyse the differences between these classes, we look at\nthe letter positional probabilities (LPPs). We find strong statistical\nassociations between several LPPs and complexity. For example, simple words are\nsignificantly (p<.001) more likely to start with w, b, s, h, g, k, j, t, y or\nf, while complex words are significantly (p<.001) more likely to start with i,\na, e, r, v, u or d. We find similar strong associations for subsequent letter\npositions, with 84 letter-position variables in the first 6 positions being\nsignificant at the p<.001 level. We then use LPPs as variables in creating a\nclassifier which can classify the two classes with an 83% accuracy. We test\nthese findings using a second data set, with 66 LPPs significant (p<.001) in\nthe first 6 positions common to both datasets. We use these 66 variables to\ncreate a classifier that is able to classify a third dataset with an accuracy\nof 70%. Finally, we create a fourth sample by combining the extreme high and\nlow scoring words generated by three classifiers built on the first three\nseparate datasets and use this sample to build a classifier which has an\naccuracy of 97%.

In addition, tuning requires significant resources, making it\nimpractical for uncommon or task-specific formats. To prevent downstream\nparsing errors we would ideally constrain the LM to only produce valid output,\nbut this is severely complicated by tokenization, which is typically both\nambiguous and misaligned with the formal grammar.

In this paper, we analyze the\nunderlying mechanism of prompt leakage, which we refer to as prompt\nmemorization, and develop corresponding defending strategies. By exploring the\nscaling laws in prompt extraction, we analyze key attributes that influence\nprompt extraction, including model sizes, prompt lengths, as well as the types\nof prompts. Then we propose two hypotheses that explain how LLMs expose their\nprompts.

Given the potential risks\nassociated with hallucinations, humans should be able to identify them. This\nresearch aims to understand the human perception of LLM hallucinations by\nsystematically varying the degree of hallucination (genuine, minor\nhallucination, major hallucination) and examining its interaction with warning\n(i.e., a warning of potential inaccuracies: absent vs. present). Participants\n(N=419) from Prolific rated the perceived accuracy and engaged with content\n(e.g., like, dislike, share) in a Q/A format. Participants ranked content as\ntruthful in the order of genuine, minor hallucination, and major hallucination,\nand user engagement behaviors mirrored this pattern. More importantly, we\nobserved that warning improved the detection of hallucination without\nsignificantly affecting the perceived truthfulness of genuine content.

These methods lead to erroneous depth predictions only within the\noverlapping region with the input image, without considering the\ncharacteristics of the target object, such as its size, shape, and position. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel adversarial patch named APARATE. This patch\npossesses the ability to selectively undermine MDE in two distinct ways: by\ndistorting the estimated distances or by creating the illusion of an object\ndisappearing from the perspective of the autonomous system. Notably, APARATE is\ndesigned to be sensitive to the shape and scale of the target object, and its\ninfluence extends beyond immediate proximity. APARATE, results in a mean depth\nestimation error surpassing $0.5$, significantly impacting as much as $99\\%$ of\nthe targeted region when applied to CNN-based MDE models. Furthermore, it\nyields a significant error of $0.34$ and exerts substantial influence over\n$94\\%$ of the target region in the context of Transformer-based MDE.\n","authors":["Amira Guesmi","Muhammad Abdullah Hanif","Ihsen Alouani","Muhammad Shafique"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01351v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07338v2","updated":"2024-08-05T16:34:43Z","published":"2023-03-13T17:59:02Z","title":"Revisiting Class-Incremental Learning with Pre-Trained Models:\n  Generalizability and Adaptivity are All You Need","summary":"  Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to adapt to emerging new classes\nwithout forgetting old ones. Traditional CIL models are trained from scratch to\ncontinually acquire knowledge as data evolves. Recently, pre-training has\nachieved substantial progress, making vast pre-trained models (PTMs) accessible\nfor CIL. Contrary to traditional methods, PTMs possess generalizable\nembeddings, which can be easily transferred for CIL. In this work, we revisit\nCIL with PTMs and argue that the core factors in CIL are adaptivity for model\nupdating and generalizability for knowledge transferring. 1) We first reveal\nthat frozen PTM can already provide generalizable embeddings for CIL.\nSurprisingly, a simple baseline (SimpleCIL) which continually sets the\nclassifiers of PTM to prototype features can beat state-of-the-art even without\ntraining on the downstream task. 2) Due to the distribution gap between\npre-trained and downstream datasets, PTM can be further cultivated with\nadaptivity via model adaptation. We propose AdaPt and mERge (APER), which\naggregates the embeddings of PTM and adapted models for classifier\nconstruction. APER is a general framework that can be orthogonally combined\nwith any parameter-efficient tuning method, which holds the advantages of PTM's\ngeneralizability and adapted model's adaptivity. 3) Additionally, considering\nprevious ImageNet-based benchmarks are unsuitable in the era of PTM due to data\noverlapping, we propose four new benchmarks for assessment, namely ImageNet-A,\nObjectNet, OmniBenchmark, and VTAB.

An often overlooked issue is the cost of\nthe labeling process, which is typically high due to the need for a significant\ninvestment in time and money associated with human experts. Existing\nsemi-supervised learning methods often focus on operating in the feature space\ncreated by the fusion of available modalities, neglecting the potential for\ncross-utilizing complementary information available in each modality.

Next, information about the instances'\nclass membership in each modality is exchanged based on the Euclidean distance\nto ensure more accurate labeling.

Most of DML methods for CBIR rely on a\nhigh number of annotated images to accurately learn model parameters of deep\nneural networks (DNNs). However, gathering such data is time-consuming and\ncostly. To address this, we propose an annotation cost-efficient active\nlearning (ANNEAL) method tailored to DML-driven CBIR in RS. ANNEAL aims to\ncreate a small but informative training set made up of similar and dissimilar\nimage pairs to be utilized for accurately learning a metric space. The\ninformativeness of image pairs is evaluated by combining uncertainty and\ndiversity criteria. To assess the uncertainty of image pairs, we introduce two\nalgorithms: 1) metric-guided uncertainty estimation (MGUE); and 2) binary\nclassifier guided uncertainty estimation (BCGUE). MGUE algorithm automatically\nestimates a threshold value that acts as a boundary between similar and\ndissimilar image pairs based on the distances in the metric space. The closer\nthe similarity between image pairs is to the estimated threshold value the\nhigher their uncertainty. BCGUE algorithm estimates the uncertainty of the\nimage pairs based on the confidence of the classifier in assigning correct\nsimilarity labels. The diversity criterion is assessed through a\nclustering-based strategy. ANNEAL combines either MGUE or BCGUE algorithm with\nthe clustering-based strategy to select the most informative image pairs, which\nare then labelled by expert annotators as similar or dissimilar. This way of\nannotating images significantly reduces the annotation cost compared to\nannotating images with land-use land-cover class labels.

As LLMs and MLLMs\nrely on vast amounts of model parameters and data to achieve emergent\ncapabilities, the importance of data is receiving increasingly widespread\nattention and recognition. Tracing and analyzing recent data-oriented works for\nMLLMs, we find that the development of models and data is not two separate\npaths but rather interconnected. On the one hand, vaster and higher-quality\ndata contribute to better performance of MLLMs; on the other hand, MLLMs can\nfacilitate the development of data. The co-development of multi-modal data and\nMLLMs requires a clear view of 1) at which development stages of MLLMs specific\ndata-centric approaches can be employed to enhance certain MLLM capabilities,\nand 2) how MLLMs, utilizing those capabilities, can contribute to multi-modal\ndata in specific roles.

Recent methods strive to integrate multi-frame visual features\ngenerated by a backbone network for pose estimation.

Comparatively, methods that attempt to\nrefine the initial heatmap fail to consider any spatio-temporal motion\nfeatures.

Specifically, we\nintroduce a context-aware joint learner that adaptively leverages initial\nheatmaps and motion flow to retrieve robust local joint feature.

It not only limits\nthe intra-modal feature representation, but also harms the robustness of\ncross-attention for multi-modal feature interaction and search-template\ncorrelation computation. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach\ncalled Cross-modulated Attention Transformer (CAFormer), which performs\nintra-modality self-correlation, inter-modality feature interaction, and\nsearch-template correlation computation in a unified attention model, for RGBT\ntracking. In particular, we first independently generate correlation maps for\neach modality and feed them into the designed Correlation Modulated Enhancement\nmodule, modulating inaccurate correlation weights by seeking the consensus\nbetween modalities. Such kind of design unifies self-attention and\ncross-attention schemes, which not only alleviates inaccurate attention weight\ncomputation in self-attention but also eliminates redundant computation\nintroduced by extra cross-attention scheme.

To fill this\ngap, we comprehensively summarize and define a new module, namely\n\\textbf{feature refinement} (FR) module, that can be applied between feature\nembedding and interaction layers.

Traditional CIL models are trained from scratch to\ncontinually acquire knowledge as data evolves. Recently, pre-training has\nachieved substantial progress, making vast pre-trained models (PTMs) accessible\nfor CIL. Contrary to traditional methods, PTMs possess generalizable\nembeddings, which can be easily transferred for CIL. In this work, we revisit\nCIL with PTMs and argue that the core factors in CIL are adaptivity for model\nupdating and generalizability for knowledge transferring. 1) We first reveal\nthat frozen PTM can already provide generalizable embeddings for CIL.\nSurprisingly, a simple baseline (SimpleCIL) which continually sets the\nclassifiers of PTM to prototype features can beat state-of-the-art even without\ntraining on the downstream task. 2) Due to the distribution gap between\npre-trained and downstream datasets, PTM can be further cultivated with\nadaptivity via model adaptation. We propose AdaPt and mERge (APER), which\naggregates the embeddings of PTM and adapted models for classifier\nconstruction. APER is a general framework that can be orthogonally combined\nwith any parameter-efficient tuning method, which holds the advantages of PTM's\ngeneralizability and adapted model's adaptivity. 3) Additionally, considering\nprevious ImageNet-based benchmarks are unsuitable in the era of PTM due to data\noverlapping, we propose four new benchmarks for assessment, namely ImageNet-A,\nObjectNet, OmniBenchmark, and VTAB.

To\naddress this problem, we propose Cross-Modality Clustering-based Self-Labeling\n(CMCSL). Based on a small set of pre-labeled data, CMCSL groups instances\nbelonging to each modality in the deep feature space and then propagates known\nlabels within the resulting clusters. Next, information about the instances'\nclass membership in each modality is exchanged based on the Euclidean distance\nto ensure more accurate labeling. Experimental evaluation conducted on 20\ndatasets derived from the MM-IMDb dataset indicates that cross-propagation of\nlabels between modalities -- especially when the number of pre-labeled\ninstances is small -- can allow for more reliable labeling and thus increase\nthe classification performance in each modality.\n","authors":["Paweł Zyblewski","Leandro L.

The literature presents numerous approaches to\nboost performance while ensuring robustness for neurorobots using sEMG, often\nresulting in models requiring high processing power, large datasets, and less\nscalable solutions.

LLMs identify the task based on the demonstration and\ngeneralize it to the prompt. Another popular hypothesis is that ICL is a form\nof meta-learning, i.e., the models learn a learning algorithm at pre-training\ntime and apply it to the demonstration. Finally, a third hypothesis argues that\nLLMs use the demonstration to select a composition of tasks learned during\npre-training to perform ICL. In this paper, we empirically explore these three\nhypotheses that explain LLMs' ability to learn in context with a suite of\nexperiments derived from common text classification tasks.

Consistent reasoning,\nwhich lies at the core of human intelligence, is the ability to handle tasks\nthat are equivalent, yet described by different sentences ('Tell me the time!'\nand 'What is the time?'). The CRP asserts that consistent reasoning implies\nfallibility -- in particular, human-like intelligence in AI necessarily comes\nwith human-like fallibility. Specifically, it states that there are problems,\ne.g. in basic arithmetic, where any AI that always answers and strives to mimic\nhuman intelligence by reasoning consistently will hallucinate (produce wrong,\nyet plausible answers) infinitely often. The paradox is that there exists a\nnon-consistently reasoning AI (which therefore cannot be on the level of human\nintelligence) that will be correct on the same set of problems. The CRP also\nshows that detecting these hallucinations, even in a probabilistic sense, is\nstrictly harder than solving the original problems, and that there are problems\nthat an AI may answer correctly, but it cannot provide a correct logical\nexplanation for how it arrived at the answer. Therefore, the CRP implies that\nany trustworthy AI (i.e., an AI that never answers incorrectly) that also\nreasons consistently must be able to say 'I don't know'.

Often the goal isn't just\npoint prediction but determining uncertainty. Quantifying uncertainty,\nespecially the aleatoric uncertainty due to the unpredictable nature of market\ndrivers, helps investors understand varying risk levels. Recently, quantile\nregression forests (QRF) have emerged as a promising solution: Unlike most\nbasic quantile regression methods that need separate models for each quantile,\nquantile regression forests estimate the entire conditional distribution of the\ntarget variable with a single model, while retaining all the salient features\nof a typical random forest. We introduce a novel approach to compute quantile\nregressions from random forests that leverages the proximity (i.e., distance\nmetric) learned by the model and infers the conditional distribution of the\ntarget variable. We evaluate the proposed methodology using publicly available\ndatasets and then apply it towards the problem of forecasting the average daily\nvolume of corporate bonds. We show that using quantile regression using Random\nForest proximities demonstrates superior performance in approximating\nconditional target distributions and prediction intervals to the original\nversion of QRF.

These probabilities may\nbe used to make the categorical decision on the class of the sample; provided\nas input to a downstream system; or provided to a human for interpretation.\nEvaluating the quality of the posteriors generated by these system is an\nessential problem which was addressed decades ago with the invention of proper\nscoring rules (PSRs). Unfortunately, much of the recent machine learning\nliterature uses calibration metrics -- most commonly, the expected calibration\nerror (ECE) -- as a proxy to assess posterior performance. The problem with\nthis approach is that calibration metrics reflect only one aspect of the\nquality of the posteriors, ignoring the discrimination performance. For this\nreason, we argue that calibration metrics should play no role in the assessment\nof posterior quality. Expected PSRs should instead be used for this job,\npreferably normalized for ease of interpretation. In this work, we first give a\nbrief review of PSRs from a practical perspective, motivating their definition\nusing Bayes decision theory. We discuss why expected PSRs provide a principled\nmeasure of the quality of a system's posteriors and why calibration metrics are\nnot the right tool for this job. We argue that calibration metrics, while not\nuseful for performance assessment, may be used as diagnostic tools during\nsystem development. With this purpose in mind, we discuss a simple and\npractical calibration metric, called calibration loss, derived from a\ndecomposition of expected PSRs. We compare this metric with the ECE and with\nthe expected score divergence calibration metric from the PSR literature and\nargue, using theoretical and empirical evidence, that calibration loss is\nsuperior to these two metrics.\n","authors":["Luciana Ferrer","Daniel Ramos"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02841v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02839v1","updated":"2024-08-05T21:25:10Z","published":"2024-08-05T21:25:10Z","title":"Optimizing Cox Models with Stochastic Gradient Descent: Theoretical\n  Foundations and Practical Guidances","summary":"  Optimizing Cox regression and its neural network variants poses substantial\ncomputational challenges in large-scale studies.

Efficiently managing, processing, and displaying this data requires\nspecialized expertise and is often tedious and repetitive. Leveraging large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to develop an automated workflow presents a highly\npromising solution.

Based on this, we propose Data-Copilot, a data analysis agent\nthat autonomously performs querying, processing, and visualization of massive\ndata tailored to diverse human requests. The advancements are twofold: First,\nit is a code-centric agent that receives human requests and generates code as\nan intermediary to handle massive data, which is quite flexible for large-scale\ndata processing tasks. Second, Data-Copilot involves a data exploration phase\nin advance, which explores how to design more universal and error-free\ninterfaces for real-time response. Specifically, it actively explores data\nsources, discovers numerous common requests, and abstracts them into many\nuniversal interfaces for daily invocation. When deployed in real-time requests,\nData-Copilot only needs to invoke these pre-designed interfaces, transforming\nraw data into visualized outputs (e.g., charts, tables) that best match the\nuser's intent.

In this paper, we demonstrate that\nnonsensical prompts composed of random tokens can also elicit the LLMs to\nrespond with hallucinations. Moreover, we provide both theoretical and\nexperimental evidence that transformers can be manipulated to produce specific\npre-define tokens by perturbing its input sequence.

However, NLP navigation studies often overlook the\nimpact of such acquired knowledge on textual descriptions. Current navigation\nstudies concentrate on egocentric local descriptions (e.g., `it will be on your\nright') that require reasoning over the agent's local perception. These\ninstructions are typically given as a sequence of steps, with each action-step\nexplicitly mentioning and being followed by a landmark that the agent can use\nto verify they are on the right path (e.g., `turn right and then you will\nsee...'). In contrast, descriptions based on knowledge acquired through a map\nprovide a complete view of the environment and capture its overall structure.\nThese instructions (e.g., `it is south of Central Park and a block north of a\npolice station') are typically non-sequential, contain allocentric relations,\nwith multiple spatial relations and implicit actions, without any explicit\nverification. This paper introduces the Rendezvous (RVS) task and dataset,\nwhich includes 10,404 examples of English geospatial instructions for reaching\na target location using map-knowledge. Our analysis reveals that RVS exhibits a\nricher use of spatial allocentric relations, and requires resolving more\nspatial relations simultaneously compared to previous text-based navigation\nbenchmarks.\n","authors":["Tzuf Paz-Argaman","Sayali Kulkarni","John Palowitch","Jason Baldridge","Reut Tsarfaty"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16364v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01961v1","updated":"2024-08-04T08:35:02Z","published":"2024-08-04T08:35:02Z","title":"Representation Bias of Adolescents in AI: A Bilingual, Bicultural Study","summary":"  Popular and news media often portray teenagers with sensationalism, as both a\nrisk to society and at risk from society. As AI begins to absorb some of the\nepistemic functions of traditional media, we study how teenagers in two\ncountries speaking two languages: 1) are depicted by AI, and 2) how they would\nprefer to be depicted. Specifically, we study the biases about teenagers\nlearned by static word embeddings (SWEs) and generative language models (GLMs),\ncomparing these with the perspectives of adolescents living in the U.S. and\nNepal. We find English-language SWEs associate teenagers with societal\nproblems, and more than 50% of the 1,000 words most associated with teenagers\nin the pretrained GloVe SWE reflect such problems. Given prompts about\nteenagers, 30% of outputs from GPT2-XL and 29% from LLaMA-2-7B GLMs discuss\nsocietal problems, most commonly violence, but also drug use, mental illness,\nand sexual taboo. Nepali models, while not free of such associations, are less\ndominated by social problems. Data from workshops with N=13 U.S. adolescents\nand N=18 Nepalese adolescents show that AI presentations are disconnected from\nteenage life, which revolves around activities like school and friendship.\nParticipant ratings of how well 20 trait words describe teens are decorrelated\nfrom SWE associations, with Pearson's r=.02, n.s. in English FastText and\nr=.06, n.s. in GloVe; and r=.06, n.s. in Nepali FastText and r=-.23, n.s. in\nGloVe.

We\nargue that the distribution of notes can be modeled by translational invariance\nand periodicity, especially using diffusion models to generalize notes by\ninjecting frequency-domain Gaussian noise. However, due to the low-density\nnature of music symbols, estimating the distribution of notes latent in the\nhigh-density solution space poses significant challenges. To address this\nproblem, we introduce the Music-Diff architecture, which fits a joint\ndistribution of notes and accompanying semantic information to generate\nsymbolic music conditionally.

Existing multi-modal sarcasm detection methods have been\nproven to overestimate performance, as they struggle to effectively capture the\nintricate sarcastic cues that arise from the interaction between an image and\ntext. To address these issues, we propose InterCLIP-MEP, a novel framework for\nmulti-modal sarcasm detection.

Most existing query\nintent classification methods rely on the users' click behavior as a supervised\nsignal to construct training samples. However, these methods based entirely on\nposterior labels may lead to serious category imbalance problems because of the\nMatthew effect in click samples. Compared with popular categories, it is\ndifficult for products under long-tail categories to obtain traffic and user\nclicks, which makes the models unable to detect users' intent for products\nunder long-tail categories. This in turn aggravates the problem that long-tail\ncategories cannot obtain traffic, forming a vicious circle. In addition, due to\nthe randomness of the user's click, the posterior label is unstable for the\nquery with similar semantics, which makes the model very sensitive to the\ninput, leading to an unstable and incomplete recall of categories.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Multi-channel Graph\nConvolutional Network (SMGCN) to address the above problems from the\nperspective of label association and semi-supervised learning.

Identifying the reasons behind a biased system is not\nstraightforward, since in many occasions they are associated with hidden\nspurious correlations which are not easy to spot. Standard approaches rely on\nbias audits performed by analyzing model performance in pre-defined subgroups\nof data samples, usually characterized by common attributes like gender or\nethnicity when it comes to people, or other specific attributes defining\nsemantically coherent groups of images. However, it is not always possible to\nknow a-priori the specific attributes defining the failure modes of visual\nrecognition systems. Recent approaches propose to discover these groups by\nleveraging large vision language models, which enable the extraction of\ncross-modal embeddings and the generation of textual descriptions to\ncharacterize the subgroups where a certain model is underperforming. In this\nwork, we argue that incorporating visual explanations (e.g. heatmaps generated\nvia GradCAM or other approaches) can boost the performance of such bias\ndiscovery and mitigation frameworks. To this end, we introduce Visually\nGrounded Bias Discovery and Mitigation (ViG-Bias), a simple yet effective\ntechnique which can be integrated to a variety of existing frameworks to\nimprove both, discovery and mitigation performance. Our comprehensive\nevaluation shows that incorporating visual explanations enhances existing\ntechniques like DOMINO, FACTS and Bias-to-Text, across several challenging\ndatasets, including CelebA, Waterbirds, and NICO++.\n","authors":["Badr-Eddine Marani","Mohamed Hanini","Nihitha Malayarukil","Stergios Christodoulidis","Maria Vakalopoulou","Enzo Ferrante"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01996v3.pdf","comment":"Accepted to ECCV 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02146v1","updated":"2024-08-04T21:09:09Z","published":"2024-08-04T21:09:09Z","title":"Video-based Pedestrian and Vehicle Traffic Analysis During Football\n  Games","summary":"  This paper utilizes video analytics to study pedestrian and vehicle traffic\nbehavior, focusing on analyzing traffic patterns during football gamedays. The\nUniversity of Florida (UF) hosts six to seven home football games on Saturdays\nduring the college football season, attracting significant pedestrian activity.\nThrough video analytics, this study provides valuable insights into the impact\nof these events on traffic volumes and safety at intersections. Comparing\npedestrian and vehicle activities on gamedays versus non-gamedays reveals\ndiffering patterns. For example, pedestrian volume substantially increases\nduring gamedays, which is positively correlated with the probability of the\naway team winning. This correlation is likely because fans of the home team\nenjoy watching difficult games. Win probabilities as an early predictor of\npedestrian volumes at intersections can be a tool to help traffic professionals\nanticipate traffic management needs. Pedestrian-to-vehicle (P2V) conflicts\nnotably increase on gamedays, particularly a few hours before games start.\nAddressing this, a \"Barnes Dance\" movement phase within the intersection is\nrecommended. Law enforcement presence during high-activity gamedays can help\nensure pedestrian compliance and enhance safety. In contrast, we identified\nthat vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) conflicts generally do not increase on gamedays\nand may even decrease due to heightened driver caution.\n","authors":["Jacques P.

However, prior works focus primarily on geometric\nreconstruction and visualization, neglecting the key role of language in\nproviding a semantic interface for navigation and fine-grained understanding.\nIn constrained 3D domains, recent methods have leveraged vision-and-language\nmodels as a strong prior of 2D visual semantics. While these models display an\nexcellent understanding of broad visual semantics, they struggle with\nunconstrained photo collections depicting such tourist landmarks, as they lack\nexpert knowledge of the architectural domain. In this work, we present a\nlocalization system that connects neural representations of scenes depicting\nlarge-scale landmarks with text describing a semantic region within the scene,\nby harnessing the power of SOTA vision-and-language models with adaptations for\nunderstanding landmark scene semantics. To bolster such models with\nfine-grained knowledge, we leverage large-scale Internet data containing images\nof similar landmarks along with weakly-related textual information.

Deep neural network models usually excel in closed-set\nclassification while performs poorly in rejecting OOD inputs. To tackle this\nproblem, numerous methods have been designed to perform open set recognition\n(OSR) or OOD rejection/detection tasks. Previous methods mostly take\npost-training score transformation or hybrid models to ensure low scores on OOD\ninputs while separating known classes. In this paper, we attempt to build a\nunified framework for building open set classifiers for both classification and\nOOD rejection. We formulate the open set recognition of $ K $-known-class as a\n$ (K+1) $-class classification problem with model trained on known-class\nsamples only. By decomposing the $ K $-class problem into $ K $ one-versus-all\n(OVA) binary classification tasks and binding some parameters, we show that\ncombining the scores of OVA classifiers can give $ (K+1) $-class posterior\nprobabilities, which enables classification and OOD rejection in a unified\nframework. To maintain the closed-set classification accuracy of the OVA\ntrained classifier, we propose a hybrid training strategy combining OVA loss\nand multi-class cross-entropy loss.

To approach this goal, we leverage a vision-language model (VLM)\nfor visual grounding and transfer its vision-language knowledge into\nreinforcement learning (RL) for object-centric tasks, which makes the agent\ncapable of zero-shot generalization to unseen objects and instructions. By\nvisual grounding, we obtain an object-grounded confidence map for the target\nobject indicated in the instruction. Based on this map, we introduce two routes\nto transfer VLM knowledge into RL. Firstly, we propose an object-grounded\nintrinsic reward function derived from the confidence map to more effectively\nguide the agent towards the target object. Secondly, the confidence map offers\na more unified, accessible task representation for the agent's policy, compared\nto language embeddings. This enables the agent to process unseen objects and\ninstructions through comprehensible visual confidence maps, facilitating\nzero-shot object-level generalization. Single-task experiments prove that our\nintrinsic reward significantly improves performance on challenging skill\nlearning. In multi-task experiments, through testing on tasks beyond the\ntraining set, we show that the agent, when provided with the confidence map as\nthe task representation, possesses better generalization capabilities than\nlanguage-based conditioning.

We provide a thorough characterization of the ARVO dataset,\nshow that it can locate fixes more accurately than Google's own OSV\nreproduction effort, and demonstrate its value for future research through two\ncase studies: firstly evaluating real-world LLM-based vulnerability repair, and\nsecondly identifying over 300 falsely patched (still-active) zero-day\nvulnerabilities from projects improperly labeled by OSS-Fuzz.\n","authors":["Xiang Mei","Pulkit Singh Singaria","Jordi Del Castillo","Haoran Xi"," Abdelouahab"," Benchikh","Tiffany Bao","Ruoyu Wang","Yan Shoshitaishvili","Adam Doupé","Hammond Pearce","Brendan Dolan-Gavitt"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02153v1.pdf","comment":"14 pages, 9 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02152v1","updated":"2024-08-04T22:00:34Z","published":"2024-08-04T22:00:34Z","title":"Generative Retrieval with Few-shot Indexing","summary":"  Existing generative retrieval (GR) approaches rely on training-based\nindexing, i.e., fine-tuning a model to memorise the associations between a\nquery and the document identifier (docid) of a relevant document.\nTraining-based indexing has three limitations: high training overhead,\nunder-utilization of the pre-trained knowledge of large language models (LLMs),\nand challenges in adapting to a dynamic document corpus.

However, its\nremarkable success has been accompanied by various attacks. Recently, the model\nhijacking attack has shown that ML models can be hijacked to execute tasks\ndifferent from their original tasks, which increases both accountability and\nparasitic computational risks. Nevertheless, thus far, this attack has only\nfocused on centralized learning. In this work, we broaden the scope of this\nattack to the federated learning domain, where multiple clients collaboratively\ntrain a global model without sharing their data. Specifically, we present\nHijackFL, the first-of-its-kind hijacking attack against the global model in\nfederated learning. The adversary aims to force the global model to perform a\ndifferent task (called hijacking task) from its original task without the\nserver or benign client noticing. To accomplish this, unlike existing methods\nthat use data poisoning to modify the target model's parameters, HijackFL\nsearches for pixel-level perturbations based on their local model (without\nmodifications) to align hijacking samples with the original ones in the feature\nspace. When performing the hijacking task, the adversary applies these cloaks\nto the hijacking samples, compelling the global model to identify them as\noriginal samples and predict them accordingly. We conduct extensive experiments\non four benchmark datasets and three popular models. Empirical results\ndemonstrate that its attack performance outperforms baselines.

As AI begins to absorb some of the\nepistemic functions of traditional media, we study how teenagers in two\ncountries speaking two languages: 1) are depicted by AI, and 2) how they would\nprefer to be depicted. Specifically, we study the biases about teenagers\nlearned by static word embeddings (SWEs) and generative language models (GLMs),\ncomparing these with the perspectives of adolescents living in the U.S. and\nNepal. We find English-language SWEs associate teenagers with societal\nproblems, and more than 50% of the 1,000 words most associated with teenagers\nin the pretrained GloVe SWE reflect such problems. Given prompts about\nteenagers, 30% of outputs from GPT2-XL and 29% from LLaMA-2-7B GLMs discuss\nsocietal problems, most commonly violence, but also drug use, mental illness,\nand sexual taboo. Nepali models, while not free of such associations, are less\ndominated by social problems. Data from workshops with N=13 U.S. adolescents\nand N=18 Nepalese adolescents show that AI presentations are disconnected from\nteenage life, which revolves around activities like school and friendship.\nParticipant ratings of how well 20 trait words describe teens are decorrelated\nfrom SWE associations, with Pearson's r=.02, n.s. in English FastText and\nr=.06, n.s. in GloVe; and r=.06, n.s. in Nepali FastText and r=-.23, n.s. in\nGloVe.

A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the\ngenerated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation.\nThus, we raise a question: When presented with a query relevant to the\npreviously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond\nincorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists? To answer this,\nwe propose a framework called MMHalSnowball to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when\nencountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer\nspecific visual questions within a curated hallucinatory conversation.\nCrucially, our experiment shows that the performance of open-source LVLMs drops\nby at least $31\\%$, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated\nhallucinations and make false claims that they would not have supported without\ndistractions. We term this phenomenon Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing. To\nmitigate this, we further propose a training-free method called Residual Visual\nDecoding, where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs with the one derived\nfrom the residual visual input, providing models with direct access to the\nvisual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than\n$24\\%$ of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintaining\ncapabilities.\n","authors":["Weihong Zhong","Xiaocheng Feng","Liang Zhao","Qiming Li","Lei Huang","Yuxuan Gu","Weitao Ma","Yuan Xu","Bing Qin"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00569v4.pdf","comment":"Accepted to ACL 2024 Main Conference. 21 pages, 20 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16804v2","updated":"2024-08-03T17:13:24Z","published":"2023-09-28T19:14:18Z","title":"Curriculum-Driven Edubot: A Framework for Developing Language Learning\n  Chatbots Through Synthesizing Conversational Data","summary":"  Chatbots have become popular in educational settings, revolutionizing how\nstudents interact with material and how teachers teach.

To exploit this,\nour STBLLM employs an N:M sparsity to perform structural binarization of the\nweights.

Due to the long-tailed distribution of relations and the\nincompleteness of KGs, there is growing interest in few-shot knowledge graph\ncompletion (FKGC). Existing FKGC methods often assume the existence of all\nentities in KGs, which may not be practical since new relations and entities\ncan emerge over time. Therefore, we focus on a more challenging task called\ninductive few-shot knowledge graph completion (I-FKGC), where both relations\nand entities during the test phase are unknown before. Inspired by the idea of\ninductive reasoning, we cast I-FKGC as an inductive reasoning problem.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel Graph Stochastic Neural Process approach\n(GS-NP), which consists of two major modules. In the first module, to obtain a\ngeneralized hypothesis (e.g., shared subgraph), we present a neural\nprocess-based hypothesis extractor that models the joint distribution of\nhypothesis, from which we can sample a hypothesis for predictions. In the\nsecond module, based on the hypothesis, we propose a graph stochastic\nattention-based predictor to test if the triple in the query set aligns with\nthe extracted hypothesis.

In this paper, we study the scaling of\ninference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if\nan LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time\ncompute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt?\nAnswering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance\nof LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff\ninference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little\nresearch attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time\ninference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for\na number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms\nto scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based\nverifier reward models; and (2) updating the model's distribution over a\nresponse adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases,\nthe effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute\ncritically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation\nmotivates applying a \"compute-optimal\" scaling strategy, which acts to most\neffectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this\ncompute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute\nscaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline.

In this Perspective, drawing from human\npsychometrics, we discuss a paradigm shift from static evaluation methods to\nadaptive testing. This involves estimating the characteristics and value of\neach test item in the benchmark and dynamically adjusting items in real-time,\ntailoring the evaluation based on the model's ongoing performance instead of\nrelying on a fixed test set. This paradigm not only provides a more robust\nability estimation but also significantly reduces the number of test items\nrequired.

We employ cross-layer augmentation techniques for\ncomprehensive knowledge coverage and dynamic updates of the Ontology schema and\ninstances. To ensure compactness, we utilize cross-layer filtering methods for\nknowledge condensation in KGs.

However, even in the era of LLM, obtaining tabular data\nfrom sensitive domains remains a challenge due to privacy or copyright\nconcerns. Hence, exploring how to effectively use models like LLMs to generate\nrealistic and privacy-preserving synthetic tabular data is urgent. In this\npaper, we take a step forward to explore LLMs for tabular data synthesis and\nprivacy protection, by introducing a new framework HARMONIC for tabular data\ngeneration and evaluation. In the tabular data generation of our framework,\nunlike previous small-scale LLM-based methods that rely on continued\npre-training, we explore the larger-scale LLMs with fine-tuning to generate\ntabular data and enhance privacy. Based on idea of the k-nearest neighbors\nalgorithm, an instruction fine-tuning dataset is constructed to inspire LLMs to\ndiscover inter-row relationships. Then, with fine-tuning, LLMs are trained to\nremember the format and connections of the data rather than the data itself,\nwhich reduces the risk of privacy leakage. In the evaluation part of our\nframework, we develop specific privacy risk metrics DLT for LLM synthetic data\ngeneration, as well as performance evaluation metrics LLE for downstream LLM\ntasks. Our experiments find that this tabular data generation framework\nachieves equivalent performance to existing methods with better privacy, which\nalso demonstrates our evaluation framework for the effectiveness of synthetic\ndata and privacy risks in LLM scenarios.\n","authors":["Yuxin Wang","Duanyu Feng","Yongfu Dai","Zhengyu Chen","Jimin Huang","Sophia Ananiadou","Qianqian Xie","Hao Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02927v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02085v2","updated":"2024-08-06T03:19:25Z","published":"2024-08-04T16:50:07Z","title":"Unleashing the Power of Data Tsunami: A Comprehensive Survey on Data\n  Assessment and Selection for Instruction Tuning of Language Models","summary":"  Instruction tuning plays a critical role in aligning large language models\n(LLMs) with human preference. Despite the vast amount of open instruction\ndatasets, naively training a LLM on all existing instructions may not be\noptimal and practical. To pinpoint the most beneficial datapoints, data\nassessment and selection methods have been proposed in the fields of natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) and deep learning. However, under the context of\ninstruction tuning, there still exists a gap in knowledge on what kind of data\nevaluation metrics can be employed and how they can be integrated into the\nselection mechanism. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive review on\nexisting literature of data assessment and selection especially for instruction\ntuning of LLMs. We systematically categorize all applicable methods into\nquality-based, diversity-based, and importance-based ones where a unified,\nfine-grained taxonomy is structured.

Current multi-modal\nbenchmarks primarily focus on facts or specific topic-related knowledge\ncontained within individual images. However, they often overlook the\nassociative relations between multiple images, which require the identification\nand analysis of similarities among entities or content present in different\nimages. Therefore, we propose the multi-image relation association task and a\nmeticulously curated Multi-granularity Multi-image Relational Association\n(MMRA) benchmark, comprising 1,024 samples. In order to systematically and\ncomprehensively evaluate current LVLMs, we establish an associational relation\nsystem among images that contain 11 subtasks (e.g, UsageSimilarity, SubEvent)\nat two granularity levels (i.e., image and entity) according to the relations\nin ConceptNet. Our experiments reveal that on the MMRA benchmark, current\nmulti-image LVLMs exhibit distinct advantages and disadvantages across various\nsubtasks. Notably, fine-grained, entity-level multi-image perception tasks pose\na greater challenge for LVLMs compared to image-level tasks. Moreover, LVLMs\nperform poorly on spatial-related tasks, indicating that LVLMs still have\nlimited spatial awareness. Additionally, our findings indicate that while LVLMs\ndemonstrate a strong capability to perceive image details, enhancing their\nability to associate information across multiple images hinges on improving the\nreasoning capabilities of their language model component.

We evaluate\nLLMs through three frameworks: single attempt, self-debugging, and\nself-debugging with self-verification and various contexts, including\nmathematical formulations, pseudo-code, and related research papers. Our\nfindings reveal that both self-debugging and self-verification enhance success\nrates without significantly lowering the optimality gap. We observe\ncontext-sensitive behavior - providing mathematical formulations as context\ndecreases the optimality gap but significantly decreases success rates and\nproviding pseudo-code and related research papers as context does not\nconsistently improve success rates or decrease the optimality gap. We identify\nkey challenges and propose future directions to enhance LLM performance in\nsolving robot routing problems.

The inherently explainable\nattribution method aims to enhance the understanding of model behavior by\nidentifying the important regions in images that significantly contribute to\npredictions. It is achieved by cooperatively training a selector (generating an\nattribution map to identify important features) and a predictor (making\npredictions using the identified features). Despite many advancements, existing\nmethods suffer from the incompleteness problem, where discriminative features\nare masked out, and the interlocking problem, where the non-optimized selector\ninitially selects noise, causing the predictor to fit on this noise and\nperpetuate the cycle.

There are two reasons for this: the\nexisting quantization paradigm does not fit the power-law distribution of\npost-Softmax activations well, and accuracy inevitably decreases after\nreparameterizing post-LayerNorm activations.

They usually overlook exploring the\npotential of inherent audio-visual correlation, leading to monotonous\nannotation within each modality instead of comprehensive and precise\ndescriptions. Such ignorance results in the difficulty of multiple\ncross-modality studies. To fulfill this gap, we present MMTrail, a large-scale\nmulti-modality video-language dataset incorporating more than 20M trailer clips\nwith visual captions, and 2M high-quality clips with multimodal captions.\nTrailers preview full-length video works and integrate context, visual frames,\nand background music. In particular, the trailer has two main advantages: (1)\nthe topics are diverse, and the content characters are of various types, e.g.,\nfilm, news, and gaming. (2) the corresponding background music is\ncustom-designed, making it more coherent with the visual context. Upon these\ninsights, we propose a systemic captioning framework, achieving various\nmodality annotations with more than 27.1k hours of trailer videos. Here, to\nensure the caption retains music perspective while preserving the authority of\nvisual context, we leverage the advanced LLM to merge all annotations\nadaptively.

The task aims to detect abnormal events in test video using unlabeled\nvideos as training data. The presence of anomalies in the training data poses a\nsignificant challenge in this task, particularly because they form clusters in\nthe feature space. We refer to this property as the \"Anomaly Cluster\" issue.\nThe condensed nature of these anomalies makes it difficult to distinguish\nbetween normal and abnormal data in the training set. Consequently, training\nconventional anomaly detection techniques using an unlabeled dataset often\nleads to sub-optimal results. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a new\nmethod called Cleansed k-Nearest Neighbor (CKNN), which explicitly filters out\nthe Anomaly Clusters by cleansing the training dataset. Following the k-nearest\nneighbor algorithm in the feature space provides powerful anomaly detection\ncapability. Although the identified Anomaly Cluster issue presents a\nsignificant challenge to applying k-nearest neighbor in UVAD, our proposed\ncleansing scheme effectively addresses this problem.

The essential of the\nEVC task is to effectively perceive subtle and ambiguous visual emotional cues\nduring the caption generation, which is neglected by the traditional video\ncaptioning. Existing emotional video captioning methods perceive global visual\nemotional cues at first, and then combine them with the video features to guide\nthe emotional caption generation, which neglects two characteristics of the EVC\ntask. Firstly, their methods neglect the dynamic subtle changes in the\nintrinsic emotions of the video, which makes it difficult to meet the needs of\ncommon scenes with diverse and changeable emotions. Secondly, as their methods\nincorporate emotional cues into each step, the guidance role of emotion is\noveremphasized, which makes factual content more or less ignored during\ngeneration. To this end, we propose a dual-path collaborative generation\nnetwork, which dynamically perceives visual emotional cues evolutions while\ngenerating emotional captions by collaborative learning. Specifically, in the\ndynamic emotion perception path, we propose a dynamic emotion evolution module,\nwhich first aggregates visual features and historical caption features to\nsummarize the global visual emotional cues, and then dynamically selects\nemotional cues required to be re-composed at each stage.

Unlike existing approach which is limited\nby the availability of image-text pairs, we have developed the first automated\npipeline that scales up multimodal data by generating multigranular visual and\ntexual annotations (in the form of image-ROI-description triplets) without the\nneed for any paired text descriptions. Specifically, data from over 90\ndifferent sources have been collected, preprocessed, and grounded using\ndomain-specific expert models to identify ROIs related to abnormal regions. We\nthen build a comprehensive knowledge base and prompt multimodal large language\nmodels to perform retrieval-augmented generation with the identified ROIs as\nguidance, resulting in multigranular texual descriptions.

Meanwhile, the implicitly learned mapping between historical\nobservations to the prediction targets tend to over-simplify the dynamics of\nreal-world urban flows, leading to suboptimal predictions. Some recent\nspatio-temporal prediction solutions bring remedies with the notion of\nphysics-guided machine learning (PGML), which describes spatio-temporal data\nwith nuanced and principled physics laws, thus enhancing both the prediction\naccuracy and interpretability.

Although the improved learning rate\nhas a mild dependence on the Gram matrix, we still need to set it small enough\nin practice due to the unknown eigenvalues of the Gram matrix. More\nimportantly, the convergence rate is tied to the least eigenvalue of the Gram\nmatrix, which can lead to slow convergence. In this work, we provide the\nconvergence analysis of natural gradient descent (NGD) in training two-layer\nPINNs, demonstrating that the learning rate can be $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, and at\nthis rate, the convergence rate is independent of the Gram matrix.\n","authors":["Xianliang Xu","Ting Du","Wang Kong","Ye Li","Zhongyi Huang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00573v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01294v2","updated":"2024-08-06T12:24:07Z","published":"2024-08-02T14:31:37Z","title":"Feature Clock: High-Dimensional Effects in Two-Dimensional Plots","summary":"  Humans struggle to perceive and interpret high-dimensional data.

The framework incorporates novel\nstate-of-the-art discriminative models for predicting hERG channel activity, as\nwell as activity against the voltage-gated NaV1.5 and CaV1.2 channels due to\ntheir potential implications in modulating the arrhythmogenic potential induced\nby hERG channel blockade.

Second, we propose a novel approach, proximal ranking policy optimization\n(PRPO), that provides safety in deployment without assumptions about user\nbehavior.

However, current video-language\ndatasets primarily provide text descriptions for visual frames, considering\naudio to be weakly related information. They usually overlook exploring the\npotential of inherent audio-visual correlation, leading to monotonous\nannotation within each modality instead of comprehensive and precise\ndescriptions. Such ignorance results in the difficulty of multiple\ncross-modality studies. To fulfill this gap, we present MMTrail, a large-scale\nmulti-modality video-language dataset incorporating more than 20M trailer clips\nwith visual captions, and 2M high-quality clips with multimodal captions.\nTrailers preview full-length video works and integrate context, visual frames,\nand background music. In particular, the trailer has two main advantages: (1)\nthe topics are diverse, and the content characters are of various types, e.g.,\nfilm, news, and gaming. (2) the corresponding background music is\ncustom-designed, making it more coherent with the visual context. Upon these\ninsights, we propose a systemic captioning framework, achieving various\nmodality annotations with more than 27.1k hours of trailer videos. Here, to\nensure the caption retains music perspective while preserving the authority of\nvisual context, we leverage the advanced LLM to merge all annotations\nadaptively. In this fashion, our MMtrail dataset potentially paves the path for\nfine-grained large multimodal-language model training.

Measuring the Social Bias in Image Generation\n  Models","summary":"  Image generation models can generate or edit images from a given text. Recent\nadvancements in image generation technology, exemplified by DALL-E and\nMidjourney, have been groundbreaking. These advanced models, despite their\nimpressive capabilities, are often trained on massive Internet datasets, making\nthem susceptible to generating content that perpetuates social stereotypes and\nbiases, which can lead to severe consequences. Prior research on assessing bias\nwithin image generation models suffers from several shortcomings, including\nlimited accuracy, reliance on extensive human labor, and lack of comprehensive\nanalysis. In this paper, we propose BiasPainter, a novel evaluation framework\nthat can accurately, automatically and comprehensively trigger social bias in\nimage generation models. BiasPainter uses a diverse range of seed images of\nindividuals and prompts the image generation models to edit these images using\ngender, race, and age-neutral queries. These queries span 62 professions, 39\nactivities, 57 types of objects, and 70 personality traits. The framework then\ncompares the edited images to the original seed images, focusing on the\nsignificant changes related to gender, race, and age. BiasPainter adopts a key\ninsight that these characteristics should not be modified when subjected to\nneutral prompts. Built upon this design, BiasPainter can trigger the social\nbias and evaluate the fairness of image generation models. We use BiasPainter\nto evaluate six widely-used image generation models, such as stable diffusion\nand Midjourney. Experimental results show that BiasPainter can successfully\ntrigger social bias in image generation models. According to our human\nevaluation, BiasPainter can achieve 90.8% accuracy on automatic bias detection,\nwhich is significantly higher than the results reported in previous work.\n","authors":["Wenxuan Wang","Haonan Bai","Jen-tse Huang","Yuxuan Wan","Youliang Yuan","Haoyi Qiu","Nanyun Peng","Michael R.

We used two pretrained LLMs utilized for\nfine-tuning research: LLaMa 2 7B, and Mistral 7B. QLoRA and RAFT are applied to\nthe two pretrained models. The inferences from these models are extensively\nevaluated against the aforementioned metrics.

To address this issue, we propose PAS, an\nLLM-based plug-and-play APE system.

In comprehensive benchmarks, PAS achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA)\nresults compared to previous APE models, with an average improvement of 6.09\npoints. Moreover, PAS is highly efficient, achieving SoTA performance with only\n9000 data points. Additionally, PAS can autonomously generate prompt\naugmentation data without requiring additional human labor. Its flexibility\nalso allows it to be compatible with all existing LLMs and applicable to a wide\nrange of tasks.

Expanding LLM capabilities to\ninclude vision-language understanding is vital, yet training them on multimodal\ndata from scratch is challenging and costly. Existing instruction tuning\nmethods, e.g., LLAVA, often connects a pretrained CLIP vision encoder and LLMs\nvia fully fine-tuning LLMs to bridge the modality gap. However, full\nfine-tuning is plagued by catastrophic forgetting, i.e., forgetting previous\nknowledge, and high training costs particularly in the era of increasing tasks\nand modalities. To solve this issue, we introduce MoExtend, an effective\nframework designed to streamline the modality adaptation and extension of\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. MoExtend seamlessly integrates new experts\ninto pre-trained MoE models, endowing them with novel knowledge without the\nneed to tune pretrained models such as MoE and vision encoders. This approach\nenables rapid adaptation and extension to new modal data or tasks, effectively\naddressing the challenge of accommodating new modalities within LLMs.\nFurthermore, MoExtend avoids tuning pretrained models, thus mitigating the risk\nof catastrophic forgetting.

Therefore, we design FourierMamba that correlates Fourier\nspace information in the spatial and channel dimensions with distinct designs.\nSpecifically, in the spatial dimension Fourier space, we introduce the zigzag\ncoding to scan the frequencies to rearrange the orders from low to high\nfrequencies, thereby orderly correlating the connections between frequencies;\nin the channel dimension Fourier space with arranged orders of frequencies in\naxis, we can directly use Mamba to perform frequency correlation and improve\nthe channel information representation.\n","authors":["Dong Li","Yidi Liu","Xueyang Fu","Senyan Xu","Zheng-Jun Zha"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19450v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03922v1","updated":"2024-08-07T17:29:19Z","published":"2024-08-07T17:29:19Z","title":"FMiFood: Multi-modal Contrastive Learning for Food Image Classification","summary":"  Food image classification is the fundamental step in image-based dietary\nassessment, which aims to estimate participants' nutrient intake from eating\noccasion images.

However, due to the diverse intra-class spatial layouts and the\ncoexisting inter-class objects, modeling contextual relationships to adapt\nvarious image characteristics is a great challenge. Existing contextual\nmodeling methods for scene recognition exhibit two limitations: 1) They\ntypically model only one type of spatial relationship (order or metric) among\nobjects within scenes, with limited exploration of diverse spatial layouts. 2)\nThey often overlook the differences in coexisting objects across different\nscenes, suppressing scene recognition performance. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose SpaCoNet, which simultaneously models Spatial relation\nand Co-occurrence of objects guided by semantic segmentation. Firstly, the\nSemantic Spatial Relation Module (SSRM) is constructed to model scene spatial\nfeatures. With the help of semantic segmentation, this module decouples spatial\ninformation from the scene image and thoroughly explores all spatial\nrelationships among objects in an end-to-end manner, thereby obtaining\nsemantic-based spatial features. Secondly, both spatial features from the SSRM\nand deep features from the Image Feature Extraction Module are allocated to\neach object, so as to distinguish the coexisting object across different\nscenes. Finally, utilizing the discriminative features above, we design a\nGlobal-Local Dependency Module to explore the long-range co-occurrence among\nobjects, and further generate a semantic-guided feature representation for\nindoor scene recognition.

From a security\nperspective, it poses a critical risk for modern vision systems, e.g., the\npopular Deep Learning as a Service (DLaaS) frameworks. For protecting deep\nmodels while not modifying them, current algorithms typically detect\nadversarial patterns through discriminative decomposition for natural and\nadversarial data. However, these decompositions are either biased towards\nfrequency resolution or spatial resolution, thus failing to capture adversarial\npatterns comprehensively. Also, when the detector relies on few fixed features,\nit is practical for an adversary to fool the model while evading the detector\n(i.e., defense-aware attack). Motivated by such facts, we propose a\ndiscriminative detector relying on a spatial-frequency Krawtchouk\ndecomposition. It expands the above works from two aspects: 1) the introduced\nKrawtchouk basis provides better spatial-frequency discriminability, capturing\nthe differences between natural and adversarial data comprehensively in both\nspatial and frequency distributions, w.r.t. the common trigonometric or wavelet\nbasis; 2) the extensive features formed by the Krawtchouk decomposition allows\nfor adaptive feature selection and secrecy mechanism, significantly increasing\nthe difficulty of the defense-aware attack, w.r.t. the detector with few fixed\nfeatures.

Early detection and intervention are crucial\nfor effective treatment and management of depression. Recently, there are many\nend-to-end deep learning methods leveraging the facial expression features for\nautomatic depression detection. However, most current methods overlook the\ntemporal dynamics of facial expressions. Although very recent 3DCNN methods\nremedy this gap, they introduce more computational cost due to the selection of\nCNN-based backbones and redundant facial features.\n  To address the above limitations, by considering the timing correlation of\nfacial expressions, we propose a novel framework called FacialPulse, which\nrecognizes depression with high accuracy and speed. By harnessing the\nbidirectional nature and proficiently addressing long-term dependencies, the\nFacial Motion Modeling Module (FMMM) is designed in FacialPulse to fully\ncapture temporal features. Since the proposed FMMM has parallel processing\ncapabilities and has the gate mechanism to mitigate gradient vanishing, this\nmodule can also significantly boost the training speed.\n  Besides, to effectively use facial landmarks to replace original images to\ndecrease information redundancy, a Facial Landmark Calibration Module (FLCM) is\ndesigned to eliminate facial landmark errors to further improve recognition\naccuracy. Extensive experiments on the AVEC2014 dataset and MMDA dataset (a\ndepression dataset) demonstrate the superiority of FacialPulse on recognition\naccuracy and speed, with the average MAE (Mean Absolute Error) decreased by 21%\ncompared to baselines, and the recognition speed increased by 100% compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

In recent years, significant research has focused on improving the\ngeneralization of deep learning models by regularizing the sharpness of the\nloss landscape. Among the optimization approaches that explicitly minimize\nsharpness, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has shown potential in enhancing\ngeneralization performance on general domain image datasets. This success has\nled to the development of several advanced sharpness-based algorithms aimed at\naddressing the limitations of SAM, such as Adaptive SAM, surrogate-Gap SAM,\nWeighted SAM, and Curvature Regularized SAM. These sharpness-based optimizers\nhave shown improvements in model generalization compared to conventional\nstochastic gradient descent optimizers and their variants on general domain\nimage datasets, but they have not been thoroughly evaluated on medical images.\nThis work provides a review of recent sharpness-based methods for improving the\ngeneralization of deep learning networks and evaluates the methods performance\non medical breast ultrasound images. Our findings indicate that the initial SAM\nmethod successfully enhances the generalization of various deep learning\nmodels.

Optimizing both of these measures\npresents a fundamental trade-off, as higher diversity typically comes at the\ncost of relevance, resulting in lower user engagement. Existing recommendation\nalgorithms try to resolve this trade-off by combining the two measures,\nrelevance and diversity, into one aim and then seeking recommendations that\noptimize the combined objective, for a given number of items to recommend.\nTraditional approaches, however, do not consider the user interaction with the\nrecommended items.\n  In this paper, we put the user at the central stage, and build on the\ninterplay between relevance, diversity, and user behavior. In contrast to\napplications where the goal is solely to maximize engagement, we focus on\nscenarios aiming at maximizing the total amount of knowledge encountered by the\nuser.

Moreover, users' short-term intent shows\nuncertainty and is affected by various factors such as browsing context and\nhistorical behaviors, which poses challenges to user intent modeling. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel model called Deep Uncertainty\nIntent Network (DUIN), comprising three essential modules: i) Explicit Intent\nExploit Module extracting explicit user intent using the contrastive learning\nparadigm; ii) Latent Intent Explore Module exploring latent user intent by\nleveraging the multi-view relationships between items; iii) Intent Uncertainty\nMeasurement Module offering a distributional estimation and capturing the\nuncertainty associated with user intent.

Current mainstream efforts mainly\ncenter around injecting personalized information from recommendation models\ninto LLMs by customizing input templates or aligning representations between\nsemantic and recommendation spaces at the prediction layer. However, they face\nthree significant limitations: (1) LoRA is mostly used as a core component in\nexisting works, but personalization is not well established in LoRA parameters\nas the LoRA matrix shared by every user may not cater to different users'\ncharacteristics, leading to suboptimal performance. (2) Although lifelong\npersonalized behavior sequences are ideal for personalization, their use raises\neffectiveness and efficiency issues since LLMs require escalating training and\ninference time to extend text lengths. (3) Existing approaches aren't scalable\nfor large datasets due to training efficiency constraints.

However, despite significant progress in the field,\nthere remains a lack of rigorous characterization regarding the innate\ninterpretability of different models. In an attempt to bridge this gap, recent\nwork has demonstrated that it is possible to formally assess interpretability\nby studying the computational complexity of explaining the decisions of various\nmodels. In this setting, if explanations for a particular model can be obtained\nefficiently, the model is considered interpretable (since it can be explained\n``easily''). However, if generating explanations over an ML model is\ncomputationally intractable, it is considered uninterpretable. Prior research\nidentified two key factors that influence the complexity of interpreting an ML\nmodel: (i) the type of the model (e.g., neural networks, decision trees, etc.);\nand (ii) the form of explanation (e.g., contrastive explanations, Shapley\nvalues, etc.). In this work, we claim that a third, important factor must also\nbe considered for this analysis -- the underlying distribution over which the\nexplanation is obtained. Considering the underlying distribution is key in\navoiding explanations that are socially misaligned, i.e., convey information\nthat is biased and unhelpful to users. We demonstrate the significant influence\nof the underlying distribution on the resulting overall interpretation\ncomplexity, in two settings: (i) prediction models paired with an external\nout-of-distribution (OOD) detector; and (ii) prediction models designed to\ninherently generate socially aligned explanations.

As a result, different thematic areas of DT have been explored.\nThis is no different in specific fields such as manufacturing, automation, oil\nand gas, and civil engineering, leading to fragmented approaches for\nfield-specific applications. The civil engineering industry is further\ndisadvantaged in this regard as it relies on external techniques by other\nengineering fields for its DT adoption.

To overcome this\nlimitation, Tank et al (IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine\nLearning, 2022) proposed a solution that uses neural networks with sparse\nregularization penalties. The regularization encourages learnable weights to be\nsparse, which enables inference on GC. This paper overcomes the limitations of\ncurrent methods by leveraging advances in machine learning and deep learning\nwhich have been demonstrated to learn hidden patterns in the data. We propose\nnovel classes of models that can handle underlying non-linearity in a\ncomputationally efficient manner, simultaneously providing GC and lag order\nselection. Firstly, we present the Learned Kernel VAR (LeKVAR) model that\nlearns kernel parameterized by a shared neural net followed by penalization on\nlearnable weights to discover GC structure. Secondly, we show one can directly\ndecouple lags and individual time series importance via decoupled penalties.\nThis is important as we want to select the lag order during the process of GC\nestimation. This decoupling acts as a filtering and can be extended to any DL\nmodel including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN),\nLong Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Transformers etc, for simultaneous GC\nestimation and lag selection.\n","authors":["Malik Shahid Sultan","Samuel Horvath","Hernando Ombao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03703v2.pdf","comment":"To be Submitted to a Journal work Presented at JSM. arXiv admin note:\n  text overlap with arXiv:1802.05842 by other authors"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19265v2","updated":"2024-08-07T09:16:12Z","published":"2024-07-27T14:16:25Z","title":"Towards Robust Few-shot Class Incremental Learning in Audio\n  Classification using Contrastive Representation","summary":"  In machine learning applications, gradual data ingress is common, especially\nin audio processing where incremental learning is vital for real-time\nanalytics.

PPCEF advances beyond existing methods by\ncombining a probabilistic formulation that leverages the data distribution with\nthe optimization of plausibility within a unified framework. Compared to\nreference approaches, our method enforces plausibility by directly optimizing\nthe explicit density function without assuming a particular family of\nparametrized distributions. This ensures CFs are not only valid (i.e., achieve\nclass change) but also align with the underlying data's probability density.\nFor that purpose, our approach leverages normalizing flows as powerful density\nestimators to capture the complex high-dimensional data distribution.\nFurthermore, we introduce a novel loss that balances the trade-off between\nachieving class change and maintaining closeness to the original instance while\nalso incorporating a probabilistic plausibility term. PPCEF's unconstrained\nformulation allows for efficient gradient-based optimization with batch\nprocessing, leading to orders of magnitude faster computation compared to prior\nmethods. Moreover, the unconstrained formulation of PPCEF allows for the\nseamless integration of future constraints tailored to specific counterfactual\nproperties.

In recent years, significant research has focused on improving the\ngeneralization of deep learning models by regularizing the sharpness of the\nloss landscape. Among the optimization approaches that explicitly minimize\nsharpness, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has shown potential in enhancing\ngeneralization performance on general domain image datasets. This success has\nled to the development of several advanced sharpness-based algorithms aimed at\naddressing the limitations of SAM, such as Adaptive SAM, surrogate-Gap SAM,\nWeighted SAM, and Curvature Regularized SAM. These sharpness-based optimizers\nhave shown improvements in model generalization compared to conventional\nstochastic gradient descent optimizers and their variants on general domain\nimage datasets, but they have not been thoroughly evaluated on medical images.\nThis work provides a review of recent sharpness-based methods for improving the\ngeneralization of deep learning networks and evaluates the methods performance\non medical breast ultrasound images. Our findings indicate that the initial SAM\nmethod successfully enhances the generalization of various deep learning\nmodels. While Adaptive SAM improves generalization of convolutional neural\nnetworks, it fails to do so for vision transformers. Other sharpness-based\noptimizers, however, do not demonstrate consistent results. The results reveal\nthat, contrary to findings in the non-medical domain, SAM is the only\nrecommended sharpness-based optimizer that consistently improves generalization\nin medical image analysis, and further research is necessary to refine the\nvariants of SAM to enhance generalization performance in this field\n","authors":["Mohamed Hassan","Aleksander Vakanski","Min Xian"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04065v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02058v2","updated":"2024-08-07T19:45:05Z","published":"2024-04-02T15:57:32Z","title":"Generalizable, Fast, and Accurate DeepQSPR with fastprop","summary":"  Quantitative Structure Property Relationship studies aim to define a mapping\nbetween molecular structure and arbitrary quantities of interest.

HiQuE can effectively capture the importance of each question in\ndiagnosing depression by learning mutual information across multiple\nmodalities. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used clinical\ninterview data, DAIC-WOZ, where our model outperforms other state-of-the-art\nmultimodal depression detection models and emotion recognition models,\nshowcasing its clinical utility in depression detection.\n","authors":["Juho Jung","Chaewon Kang","Jeewoo Yoon","Seungbae Kim","Jinyoung Han"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03648v1.pdf","comment":"11 pages, 6 figures, Proceedings of the 33rd ACM International\n  Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM '24)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03637v1","updated":"2024-08-07T08:52:21Z","published":"2024-08-07T08:52:21Z","title":"TALE: Training-free Cross-domain Image Composition via Adaptive Latent\n  Manipulation and Energy-guided Optimization","summary":"  We present TALE, a novel training-free framework harnessing the generative\ncapabilities of text-to-image diffusion models to address the cross-domain\nimage composition task that focuses on flawlessly incorporating user-specified\nobjects into a designated visual contexts regardless of domain disparity.\nPrevious methods often involve either training auxiliary networks or finetuning\ndiffusion models on customized datasets, which are expensive and may undermine\nthe robust textual and visual priors of pre-trained diffusion models.

However, a research gap exists to support\nfully autonomous GIS agents: how to enable agents to discover and download the\nnecessary data for geospatial analyses. This study proposes an autonomous GIS\nagent framework capable of retrieving required geospatial data by generating,\nexecuting, and debugging programs. The framework utilizes the LLM as the\ndecision-maker, selects the appropriate data source (s) from a pre-defined\nsource list, and fetches the data from the chosen source. Each data source has\na handbook that records the metadata and technical details for data retrieval.\nThe proposed framework is designed in a plug-and-play style to ensure\nflexibility and extensibility. Human users or autonomous data scrawlers can add\nnew data sources by adding new handbooks. We developed a prototype agent based\non the framework, released as a QGIS plugin (GeoData Retrieve Agent) and a\nPython program. Experiment results demonstrate its capability of retrieving\ndata from various sources including OpenStreetMap, administrative boundaries\nand demographic data from the US Census Bureau, satellite basemaps from ESRI\nWorld Imagery, global digital elevation model (DEM) from OpenTopography.org,\nweather data from a commercial provider, the COVID-19 cases from the NYTimes\nGitHub.

Despite\nongoing efforts to make LLMs safe, they can still be made to behave unsafely\nwith jailbreaking, a technique in which models are prompted to act outside\ntheir operational guidelines. Research on LLM safety and jailbreaking, however,\nhas so far mostly focused on English, limiting our understanding of LLM safety\nin other languages. We contribute towards closing this gap by investigating the\neffectiveness of many-shot jailbreaking, where models are prompted with unsafe\ndemonstrations to induce unsafe behaviour, in Italian. To enable our analysis,\nwe create a new dataset of unsafe Italian question-answer pairs. With this\ndataset, we identify clear safety vulnerabilities in four families of\nopen-weight LLMs. We find that the models exhibit unsafe behaviors even when\nprompted with few unsafe demonstrations, and -- more alarmingly -- that this\ntendency rapidly escalates with more demonstrations.\n","authors":["Fabio Pernisi","Dirk Hovy","Paul Röttger"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04522v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted at ACL 2024 (Student Research Workshop)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04519v1","updated":"2024-08-08T15:20:39Z","published":"2024-08-08T15:20:39Z","title":"Articulatory Configurations across Genders and Periods in French Radio\n  and TV archives","summary":"  This paper studies changes in articulatory configurations across genders and\nperiods using an inversion from acoustic to articulatory parameters.

Existing watermark techniques are shown\neffective in embedding single human-imperceptible and machine-detectable\npatterns without significantly affecting generated text quality and semantics.\nHowever, the efficiency in detecting watermarks, i.e., the minimum number of\ntokens required to assert detection with significance and robustness against\npost-editing, is still debatable. In this paper, we propose, Duwak, to\nfundamentally enhance the efficiency and quality of watermarking by embedding\ndual secret patterns in both token probability distribution and sampling\nschemes. To mitigate expression degradation caused by biasing toward certain\ntokens, we design a contrastive search to watermark the sampling scheme, which\nminimizes the token repetition and enhances the diversity. We theoretically\nexplain the interdependency of the two watermarks within Duwak. We evaluate\nDuwak extensively on Llama2 under various post-editing attacks, against four\nstate-of-the-art watermarking techniques and combinations of them. Our results\nshow that Duwak marked text achieves the highest watermarked text quality at\nthe lowest required token count for detection, up to 70% tokens less than\nexisting approaches, especially under post paraphrasing.\n","authors":["Chaoyi Zhu","Jeroen Galjaard","Pin-Yu Chen","Lydia Y.

For affective computing systems,\nan understanding of how users regulate their emotions can be highly useful, for\nexample to provide feedback in job interview training, or in psychotherapeutic\nscenarios. However, at present no method to automatically classify different\nemotion regulation strategies in a cross-user scenario exists.

To close this gap, we make use of the\nrecently introduced \\textsc{Deep} corpus for modeling the social display of the\nemotion shame, where each point in time is annotated with one of seven\ndifferent emotion regulation classes. We fine-tune Llama2-7B as well as the\nrecently introduced Gemma model using Low-rank Optimization on prompts\ngenerated from different sources of information on the \\textsc{Deep} corpus.\nThese include verbal and nonverbal behavior, person factors, as well as the\nresults of an in-depth interview after the interaction.

Addressing this, the development of\npersonality traits in LLMs emerges as a crucial area of research to unlock\ntheir latent potential. Existing methods to personify LLMs generally involve\nstrategies like employing stylized training data for instruction tuning or\nusing prompt engineering to simulate different personalities.

In this study, we propose PersLLM, integrating\npsychology-grounded principles of personality: social practice, consistency,\nand dynamic development, into a comprehensive training methodology. We\nincorporate personality traits directly into the model parameters, enhancing\nthe model's resistance to induction, promoting consistency, and supporting the\ndynamic evolution of personality.

In recent years, as Pre-trained\nLanguage Models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various NLP\ndownstream tasks, utilizing PLMs as backbones has become a common practice in\nrecent research of IL in NLP. Most assume that catastrophic forgetting is the\nbiggest obstacle to achieving superior IL performance and propose various\ntechniques to overcome this issue. However, we find that this assumption is\nproblematic. Specifically, we revisit more than 20 methods on four\nclassification tasks (Text Classification, Intent Classification, Relation\nExtraction, and Named Entity Recognition) under the two most popular IL\nsettings (Class-Incremental and Task-Incremental) and reveal that most of them\nseverely underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting ability of PLMs. Based on\nthe observation, we propose a frustratingly easy method called SEQ* for IL with\nPLMs. The results show that SEQ* has competitive or superior performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) IL methods and requires considerably less\ntrainable parameters and training time.

Prior\nwork has attributed this behavior to either a fundamental and unavoidable\ninadequacy of modes in probabilistic models or weaknesses in language modeling.\nContrastingly, we argue that degenerate modes can even occur in the absence of\nany modeling error, due to contamination of the training data. Specifically, we\nargue that mixing even a tiny amount of low-entropy noise with a population\ntext distribution can cause the data distribution's mode to become degenerate.\nWe therefore propose to apply MAP decoding to the model's true conditional\ndistribution where the conditioning variable explicitly avoids specific\ndegenerate behavior. Using exact search, we empirically verify that the\nlength-conditional modes of machine translation models and language models are\nindeed more fluent and topical than their unconditional modes.

In this\nwork, we investigate the varying redundancy across different modules within\nTransformers, including Blocks, MLP, and Attention layers, using a\nsimilarity-based metric. This metric operates on the premise that redundant\nstructures produce outputs highly similar to their inputs. Surprisingly, while\nattention layers are essential for transformers and distinguish them from other\nmainstream architectures, we found that a large proportion of attention layers\nexhibit excessively high similarity and can be safely pruned without degrading\nperformance, leading to reduced memory and computation costs.

However, there are certain\nchallenges that hinder the deployment of AI models \"in-the-wild\" scenarios,\ni.e., inefficient use of unlabeled data, lack of incorporation of human\nexpertise, and lack of interpretation of the results. To mitigate these\nchallenges, we propose a novel Explainable Active Learning (XAL) model,\nXAL-based semantic segmentation model \"SegXAL\", that can (i) effectively\nutilize the unlabeled data, (ii) facilitate the \"Human-in-the-loop\" paradigm,\nand (iii) augment the model decisions in an interpretable way. In particular,\nwe investigate the application of the SegXAL model for semantic segmentation in\ndriving scene scenarios. The SegXAL model proposes the image regions that\nrequire labeling assistance from Oracle by dint of explainable AI (XAI) and\nuncertainty measures in a weakly-supervised manner. Specifically, we propose a\nnovel Proximity-aware Explainable-AI (PAE) module and Entropy-based Uncertainty\n(EBU) module to get an Explainable Error Mask, which enables the machine\nteachers/human experts to provide intuitive reasoning behind the results and to\nsolicit feedback to the AI system via an active learning strategy. Such a\nmechanism bridges the semantic gap between man and machine through\ncollaborative intelligence, where humans and AI actively enhance each other's\ncomplementary strengths. A novel high-confidence sample selection technique\nbased on the DICE similarity coefficient is also presented within the SegXAL\nframework.

The new model is based on the original YOLOv5 (You\nLook Only Once) with some modifications. The structure of the head part of\nYOLOv5 is modified by adding asymmetrical pooling layers. As a result, the\naccuracy of the algorithm is improved while ensuring the speed. The\nperformances of the new model in this article are compared with original YOLOv5\nmodel and analyzed from several parameters. And the evaluation of the new model\nis presented in four situations.

Despite the extensive investigation\nof temporal deep learning models, such as CNNs, RNNs, and transformers, their\nextensive parameters often pose significant computational and memory\nconstraints, rendering them less suitable for resource-constrained mobile\nhealth applications. This study introduces HARMamba, an innovative light-weight\nand versatile HAR architecture that combines selective bidirectional State\nSpaces Model and hardware-aware design. To optimize real-time resource\nconsumption in practical scenarios, HARMamba employs linear recursive\nmechanisms and parameter discretization, allowing it to selectively focus on\nrelevant input sequences while efficiently fusing scan and recompute\noperations. The model employs independent channels to process sensor data\nstreams, dividing each channel into patches and appending classification tokens\nto the end of the sequence. It utilizes position embedding to represent the\nsequence order. The patch sequence is subsequently processed by HARMamba Block,\nand the classification head finally outputs the activity category. The HARMamba\nBlock serves as the fundamental component of the HARMamba architecture,\nenabling the effective capture of more discriminative activity sequence\nfeatures. HARMamba outperforms contemporary state-of-the-art frameworks,\ndelivering comparable or better accuracy with significantly reducing\ncomputational and memory demands. It's effectiveness has been extensively\nvalidated on 4 publically available datasets namely PAMAP2, WISDM, UNIMIB SHAR\nand UCI.

However, adapting on incoming\nsite leads to catastrophic forgetting on past sites and decreases\ngeneralizablity on unseen sites. Existing Continual Learning (CL) and Domain\nGeneralization (DG) methods have been proposed to solve these two challenges\nrespectively, but none of them can address both simultaneously. Recognizing\nthis limitation, this paper proposes a novel training paradigm, learning\ntowards Synchronous Memorizability and Generalizability (SMG-Learning). To\nachieve this, we create the orientational gradient alignment to ensure\nmemorizability on previous sites, and arbitrary gradient alignment to enhance\ngeneralizability on unseen sites. This approach is named as Parallel Gradient\nAlignment (PGA). Furthermore, we approximate the PGA as dual meta-objectives\nusing the first-order Taylor expansion to reduce computational cost of aligning\ngradients. Considering that performing gradient alignments, especially for\nprevious sites, is not feasible due to the privacy constraints, we design a\nSite-Modulated Diffusion (SMD) model to generate images with site-specific\nlearnable prompts, replaying images have similar data distributions as previous\nsites.

Once trained, we can restore pixel-aligned CLIP embeddings through\nfeature grids from rendered features for open-vocabulary queries. Comparisons\nwith other state-of-the-art methods prove that FastLGS can achieve the first\nplace performance concerning both speed and accuracy, where FastLGS is 98x\nfaster than LERF and 4x faster than LangSplat. Meanwhile, experiments show that\nFastLGS is adaptive and compatible with many downstream tasks, such as 3D\nsegmentation and 3D object inpainting, which can be easily applied to other 3D\nmanipulation systems.\n","authors":["Yuzhou Ji","He Zhu","Junshu Tang","Wuyi Liu","Zhizhong Zhang","Yuan Xie","Xin Tan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01916v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04150v1","updated":"2024-08-08T01:31:38Z","published":"2024-08-08T01:31:38Z","title":"Decorrelating Structure via Adapters Makes Ensemble Learning Practical\n  for Semi-supervised Learning","summary":"  In computer vision, traditional ensemble learning methods exhibit either a\nlow training efficiency or the limited performance to enhance the reliability\nof deep neural networks.

We\nexplore deep learning-based artifact reduction in sparse-view cranial CT scans\nand its impact on automated hemorrhage detection. Methods: We trained a U-Net\nfor artefact reduction on simulated sparse-view cranial CT scans from 3000\npatients obtained from a public dataset and reconstructed with varying levels\nof sub-sampling. Additionally, we trained a convolutional neural network on\nfully sampled CT data from 17,545 patients for automated hemorrhage detection.\nWe evaluated the classification performance using the area under the receiver\noperator characteristic curves (AUC-ROCs) with corresponding 95% confidence\nintervals (CIs) and the DeLong test, along with confusion matrices. The\nperformance of the U-Net was compared to an analytical approach based on total\nvariation (TV). Results: The U-Net performed superior compared to unprocessed\nand TV-processed images with respect to image quality and automated hemorrhage\ndiagnosis. With U-Net post-processing, the number of views can be reduced from\n4096 (AUC-ROC: 0.974; 95% CI: 0.972-0.976) views to 512 views (0.973;\n0.971-0.975) with minimal decrease in hemorrhage detection (P<.001) and to 256\nviews (0.967; 0.964-0.969) with a slight performance decrease (P<.001).\nConclusion: The results suggest that U-Net based artifact reduction\nsubstantially enhances automated hemorrhage detection in sparse-view cranial\nCTs.

A\n  Case Study on Sparse Linear Regression","summary":"  Despite the remarkable success of transformer-based models in various\nreal-world tasks, their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent\nstudies have suggested that transformers can implement gradient descent as an\nin-context learner for linear regression problems and have developed various\ntheoretical analyses accordingly. However, these works mostly focus on the\nexpressive power of transformers by designing specific parameter constructions,\nlacking a comprehensive understanding of their inherent working mechanisms\npost-training. In this study, we consider a sparse linear regression problem\nand investigate how a trained multi-head transformer performs in-context\nlearning. We experimentally discover that the utilization of multi-heads\nexhibits different patterns across layers: multiple heads are utilized and\nessential in the first layer, while usually only a single head is sufficient\nfor subsequent layers. We provide a theoretical explanation for this\nobservation: the first layer preprocesses the context data, and the following\nlayers execute simple optimization steps based on the preprocessed context.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that such a preprocess-then-optimize algorithm can\nsignificantly outperform naive gradient descent and ridge regression\nalgorithms. Further experimental results support our explanations.

We take this practical trick one step\nfurther to consider how to systematically select good tasks to train,\nmaximizing overall performance across a range of tasks. Given the high cost of\ntraining, it is critical to choose a small set of training tasks. The key idea\nbehind our approach is to explicitly model the performance loss (generalization\ngap) incurred by transferring a trained model.

More recently, Deep Learning approaches\nhave been shown to provide improved performance in detection. However,\nobtaining sufficient labelled weather radar data for flying animals to build\nlearning-based models is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address the\nchallenge of data labelling, we propose a self-supervised learning method for\ndetecting animal movement.

While offline RL has\nbeen successful in learning real-world robot control policies, it typically\nrequires large amounts of expert-quality data to learn effective policies that\ngeneralize to out-of-distribution states. Unfortunately, such data is often\ndifficult and expensive to acquire in real-world tasks. Several recent works\nhave leveraged data augmentation (DA) to inexpensively generate additional\ndata, but most DA works apply augmentations in a random fashion and ultimately\nproduce highly suboptimal augmented experience. In this work, we propose Guided\nData Augmentation (GuDA), a human-guided DA framework that generates\nexpert-quality augmented data. The key insight behind GuDA is that while it may\nbe difficult to demonstrate the sequence of actions required to produce expert\ndata, a user can often easily characterize when an augmented trajectory segment\nrepresents progress toward task completion. Thus, a user can restrict the space\nof possible augmentations to automatically reject suboptimal augmented data. To\nextract a policy from GuDA, we use off-the-shelf offline reinforcement learning\nand behavior cloning algorithms. We evaluate GuDA on a physical robot soccer\ntask as well as simulated D4RL navigation tasks, a simulated autonomous driving\ntask, and a simulated soccer task.

A principal\nfactor contributing to this suboptimal performance is the inherent simplicity\nbias of neural networks trained through Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD),\nwhich prefer simpler features over more complex yet equally or more predictive\nones. This bias leads to a reliance on spurious correlations, adversely\naffecting OOD performance in various tasks such as image recognition, natural\nlanguage understanding, and graph classification. Current methodologies,\nincluding subgraph-mixup and information bottleneck approaches, have achieved\npartial success but struggle to overcome simplicity bias, often reinforcing\nspurious correlations. To tackle this, we propose DIVE, training a collection\nof models to focus on all label-predictive subgraphs by encouraging the models\nto foster divergence on the subgraph mask, which circumvents the limitation of\na model solely focusing on the subgraph corresponding to simple structural\npatterns. Specifically, we employs a regularizer to punish overlap in extracted\nsubgraphs across models, thereby encouraging different models to concentrate on\ndistinct structural patterns.

The impact of this bias in machine\nlearning (ML) models remains unclear. This study addresses the technical\nchallenges of quantifying the impact of medical device bias in downstream ML.\nOur experiments compare a \"perfect world\", without pulse oximetry bias, using\nSaO2 (blood-gas), to the \"actual world\", with biased measurements, using SpO2\n(pulse oximetry). Under this counterfactual design, two models are trained with\nidentical data, features, and settings, except for the method of measuring\noxygen saturation: models using SaO2 are a \"control\" and models using SpO2 a\n\"treatment\". The blood-gas oximetry linked dataset was a suitable test-bed,\ncontaining 163,396 nearly-simultaneous SpO2 - SaO2 paired measurements, aligned\nwith a wide array of clinical features and outcomes.

Here we explore whether such\nobject-related actions can boost SSL. For this, we extract the actions\nperformed to change from one ego-centric view of an object to another in four\nvideo datasets. We then introduce a new loss function to learn visual and\naction embeddings by aligning the performed action with the representations of\ntwo images extracted from the same clip. This permits the performed actions to\nstructure the latent visual representation. Our experiments show that our\nmethod consistently outperforms previous methods on downstream category\nrecognition. In our analysis, we find that the observed improvement is\nassociated with a better viewpoint-wise alignment of different objects from the\nsame category. Overall, our work demonstrates that embodied interactions with\nobjects can improve SSL of object categories.\n","authors":["Arthur Aubret","Céline Teulière","Jochen Triesch"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06704v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16010v2","updated":"2024-08-08T09:12:13Z","published":"2024-07-22T19:33:12Z","title":"AIDE: Antithetical, Intent-based, and Diverse Example-Based Explanations","summary":"  For many use-cases, it is often important to explain the prediction of a\nblack-box model by identifying the most influential training data samples.\nExisting approaches lack customization for user intent and often provide a\nhomogeneous set of explanation samples, failing to reveal the model's reasoning\nfrom different angles.\n  In this paper, we propose AIDE, an approach for providing antithetical (i.e.,\ncontrastive), intent-based, diverse explanations for opaque and complex models.\nAIDE distinguishes three types of explainability intents: interpreting a\ncorrect, investigating a wrong, and clarifying an ambiguous prediction.

In this paper, we investigate such vulnerabilities\nthrough developing a novel attack to disrupt the VFL inference process, under a\npractical scenario where the adversary is able to adaptively corrupt a subset\nof clients.

Moreover, to\nfurther utilize global topological information, we propose Hodge Potential\nScore (HPS) as a novel module to calculate the topological importance of nodes.\nHPS derives a global node ranking via Hodge decomposition on graphs, providing\nmore accurate global topological information compared to neighbor sampling. By\nexcluding neighbor sampling, HPS significantly reduces buffer storage costs for\nacquiring topological information and simultaneously decreases training time.\nCompared with state-of-the-art methods, FTF-ER achieves a significant\nimprovement of 3.6% in AA and 7.1% in AF on the OGB-Arxiv dataset,\ndemonstrating its superior performance in the class-incremental learning\nsetting.\n","authors":["Jinhui Pang","Changqing Lin","Xiaoshuai Hao","Rong Yin","Zixuan Wang","Zhihui Zhang","Jinglin He","Huang Tai Sheng"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19429v3.pdf","comment":"Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04283v1","updated":"2024-08-08T07:41:16Z","published":"2024-08-08T07:41:16Z","title":"Prompt-Assisted Semantic Interference Cancellation on Moderate\n  Interference Channels","summary":"  The performance of conventional interference management strategies degrades\nwhen interference power is comparable to signal power.

Channel-dependent models capture complex\ndependencies that channel-independent models cannot capture. However, the\nnumber of channels in real-world applications outpaces the capabilities of\nexisting channel-dependent models, and contrary to common expectations, some\nmodels underperform the channel-independent models in handling high-dimensional\ndata, which raises questions about the performance of channel-dependent models.\nTo address this, our study first investigates the reasons behind the suboptimal\nperformance of these channel-dependent models on high-dimensional MTS data. Our\nanalysis reveals that two primary issues lie in the introduced noise from\nunrelated series that increases the difficulty of capturing the crucial\ninter-channel dependencies, and challenges in training strategies due to\nhigh-dimensional data. To address these issues, we propose STHD, the Scalable\nTransformer for High-Dimensional Multivariate Time Series Forecasting.

One particular challenge involves\ndesigning learning systems that exhibit built-in responses to specific abstract\nstimulus patterns, yet are still plastic enough to be agnostic about the\nmodality and exact form of their inputs. In this paper, we investigate what we\ncall The Ungrounded Alignment Problem, which asks How can we build in\npredefined knowledge in a system where we don't know how a given stimulus will\nbe grounded? This paper examines a simplified version of the general problem,\nwhere an unsupervised learner is presented with a sequence of images for the\ncharacters in a text corpus, and this learner is later evaluated on its ability\nto recognize specific (possibly rare) sequential patterns. Importantly, the\nlearner is given no labels during learning or evaluation, but must map images\nfrom an unknown font or permutation to its correct class label. That is, at no\npoint is our learner given labeled images, where an image vector is explicitly\nassociated with a class label. Despite ample work in unsupervised and\nself-supervised loss functions, all current methods require a labeled\nfine-tuning phase to map the learned representations to correct classes.\nFinding this mapping in the absence of labels may seem a fool's errand, but our\nmain result resolves this seeming paradox. We show that leveraging only letter\nbigram frequencies is sufficient for an unsupervised learner both to reliably\nassociate images to class labels and to reliably identify trigger words in the\nsequence of inputs.

Most of the existing anomaly\ndetection methods focus on learning the normal behaviour of unlabelled time\nseries in an unsupervised manner. The normal boundary is often defined tightly,\nresulting in slight deviations being classified as anomalies, consequently\nleading to a high false positive rate and a limited ability to generalise\nnormal patterns. To address this, we introduce a novel end-to-end\nself-supervised ContrAstive Representation Learning approach for time series\nAnomaly detection (CARLA). While existing contrastive learning methods assume\nthat augmented time series windows are positive samples and temporally distant\nwindows are negative samples, we argue that these assumptions are limited as\naugmentation of time series can transform them to negative samples, and a\ntemporally distant window can represent a positive sample. Our contrastive\napproach leverages existing generic knowledge about time series anomalies and\ninjects various types of anomalies as negative samples. Therefore, CARLA not\nonly learns normal behaviour but also learns deviations indicating anomalies.\nIt creates similar representations for temporally closed windows and distinct\nones for anomalies. Additionally, it leverages the information about\nrepresentations' neighbours through a self-supervised approach to classify\nwindows based on their nearest/furthest neighbours to further enhance the\nperformance of anomaly detection.

Additionally, we trained a convolutional neural network on\nfully sampled CT data from 17,545 patients for automated hemorrhage detection.\nWe evaluated the classification performance using the area under the receiver\noperator characteristic curves (AUC-ROCs) with corresponding 95% confidence\nintervals (CIs) and the DeLong test, along with confusion matrices. The\nperformance of the U-Net was compared to an analytical approach based on total\nvariation (TV). Results: The U-Net performed superior compared to unprocessed\nand TV-processed images with respect to image quality and automated hemorrhage\ndiagnosis. With U-Net post-processing, the number of views can be reduced from\n4096 (AUC-ROC: 0.974; 95% CI: 0.972-0.976) views to 512 views (0.973;\n0.971-0.975) with minimal decrease in hemorrhage detection (P<.001) and to 256\nviews (0.967; 0.964-0.969) with a slight performance decrease (P<.001).\nConclusion: The results suggest that U-Net based artifact reduction\nsubstantially enhances automated hemorrhage detection in sparse-view cranial\nCTs. Our findings highlight that appropriate post-processing is crucial for\noptimal image quality and diagnostic accuracy while minimizing radiation dose.\n","authors":["Johannes Thalhammer","Manuel Schultheiss","Tina Dorosti","Tobias Lasser","Franz Pfeiffer","Daniela Pfeiffer","Florian Schaff"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.09340v4.pdf","comment":"11 pages, 6 figures, 1 table"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15786v4","updated":"2024-08-08T00:30:20Z","published":"2024-06-22T08:41:48Z","title":"What Matters in Transformers? Not All Attention is Needed","summary":"  Scaling Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated\npromising performance across various tasks. However, it also introduces\nredundant structures, posing challenges for real-world deployment. Despite some\nrecognition of redundancy in LLMs, the variability of redundancy across\ndifferent modules, such as MLP and Attention layers, is under-explored. In this\nwork, we investigate the varying redundancy across different modules within\nTransformers, including Blocks, MLP, and Attention layers, using a\nsimilarity-based metric. This metric operates on the premise that redundant\nstructures produce outputs highly similar to their inputs. Surprisingly, while\nattention layers are essential for transformers and distinguish them from other\nmainstream architectures, we found that a large proportion of attention layers\nexhibit excessively high similarity and can be safely pruned without degrading\nperformance, leading to reduced memory and computation costs. Additionally, we\nfurther propose a method that jointly drops Attention and MLP layers, achieving\nimproved performance and dropping ratios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our methods, e.g., Llama-3-70B maintains comparable\nperformance even after pruning half of the attention layers.

Compared to using text or graph\nmodalities, the investigation of utilizing images for temporal event\nforecasting has not been fully explored, especially in the era of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). To bridge this gap, we are particularly interested in\ntwo key questions of: 1) why images will help in temporal event forecasting,\nand 2) how to integrate images into the LLM-based forecasting framework. To\nanswer these research questions, we propose to identify two essential functions\nthat images play in the scenario of temporal event forecasting, i.e.,\nhighlighting and complementary. Then, we develop a novel framework, named\nMM-Forecast. It employs an Image Function Identification module to recognize\nthese functions as verbal descriptions using multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs), and subsequently incorporates these function descriptions into\nLLM-based forecasting models. To evaluate our approach, we construct a new\nmultimodal dataset, MidEast-TE-mm, by extending an existing event dataset\nMidEast-TE-mini with images. Empirical studies demonstrate that our MM-Forecast\ncan correctly identify the image functions, and further more, incorporating\nthese verbal function descriptions significantly improves the forecasting\nperformance.
